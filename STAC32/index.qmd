# Applications of Statistical Methods

## Ken Butler

![bad picture](ken.jpg)

Welcome to the home page for STAC32. This is the place to look for all things
course-related (notes, assignments, announcements etc., linked above) except for
assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca).

This is an applied course. Expect to be describing the process by which you got
your answers, and explaining what the answers mean *in the context of the data
you are working with*: that is to say, using your language skills as well as
your statistical skills. Be prepared to show your understanding and insight;
this course is about a lot more than "getting the answer". 

In real life, people
do Statistics to make decisions or inform actions, and you will be expected to
play your full part in that process, both in this course and in your statistical
future.

## News (most recent at the top):

- 2025-10-06 12:00: Monday update:
  - lectures this week:
    - the rest of power of hypothesis tests
    - sign test (probably Thursday)
  - worksheet 5, for Wednesday's tutorial, up on the [worksheets page](all_worksheets.qmd), which will help you in preparing for the midterm. Solutions to it will be available Wed night.
  - assignment 3 is due *tonight*, and solutions to it will be available after it closes on Wed night. Assignment 4 will open on Wed night, but is not due until October 20.
  - MIDTERM on Friday. See announcement on Quercus for where, when, and what.

- 2025-10-03 16:30: Worksheet 5, for the Oct 8 tutorial, is up on the [worksheets page](all_worksheets.qmd).

- 2025-10-02 00:45: Assignment 2 is closed. My solutions are on the [assignment solutions page](all_assignments.qmd).

- 2025-10-01 20:30: Assignment 3 is open. My solutions to worksheet 4 are on the [worksheets page](all_worksheets.qmd).

- 2025-10-01 15:30: we have a [midterm](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/406234/discussion_topics/3197125) exam in more or less final form. It has 30 questions, along the lines of the ones in the assignments, worth a total of 69 marks.

- 2025-09-29 11:00: Assignment 1 has been marked, and I am about to post the marks. Before I do, note the following:
  - the marking has been carried out according to a rubric (which is attached to your marked assignment on Quercus). You should read through the rubric along with [my solutions on this page](all_assignments.qmd) to the assignment to understand why you earned the mark you did.
  - the marker has been as consistent as possible across all students, and you may not appeal the marker's judgment.
  - the marker can only assess the work they can see. For example, if your graphs or code are not visible in the work you submit, you cannot get credit for them. It is *your* responsibility to check that the work you submit is the work you intended to submit, and to fix any problems if it is not. (You may resubmit an assignment until the assignment closes, but the grader will only mark the *last* of your submissions.)
  - if there is an *error* (not a marking judgment) in the marking of your assignment, you may appeal by doing the following, *between the dates of October 2 and October 9, inclusive, only* for this assignment:
    - send me email with, in the subject line, the course number, the assignment number, and the word "appeal"
    - explain precisely what and where the *error* (not marking judgment) was in the marking of your work, with reference to the rubric and to my solutions. 
    - after the appeals on this assignment have closed, I will re-read the question you referred to, and may also re-read the rest of your assignment, and make adjustments as I deem appropriate. Note that this means your assignment mark may go *down* after your appeal. After I have read your appeal and made any adjustments, the assignment mark is final.
  - appealing your mark before the opening date (Oct 2 for this assignment) *disqualifies* you from any further appeals on that assignment.

- 2025-09-28 12:30: another "Monday update" on Sunday:
  - Lectures this week:
    - bootstrap sampling distribution of sample mean
    - power of hypothesis tests
  - tutorial this week: Worksheet 4, on one-sample and two-sample $t$-tests and confidence intervals, with solutions available Wed night
  - assignment 2 due on Monday night (29th); assignment 3 opens on Wed night and is due the following Monday night (Oct 6th). 
  

- 2025-09-25 15:05: Worksheet 4, for next week's tutorial, is up on the [worksheets page](all_worksheets.qmd).

- 2025-09-25 10:15: Assignment 1 is closed; my solutions are up on the [assignment solutions page](all_assignments.qmd). My solutions to yesterday's Worksheet 3 are up on the [worksheets page](all_worksheets.qmd). Assignment 2 is open.

- 2025-09-21 15:00: an early "Monday" update:
  - Lectures this week on [one-sample and two-sample inference](http://ritsokiguess.site/lecture-notes/inference_1.html). The statistical material should be (almost all) familiar, but the coding will be new, and we will look at things with more depth than you did in your first course.
  - Tutorial this week: Worksheet 3 questions on the [worksheets page](all_worksheets.qmd). My solutions will go up after tutorial.
  - Reminder that Assignment 1 is due on Monday 22nd at 11:59pm. Assignment 2 will open on Wednesday evening, on the same material as Worksheet 3.

- 2025-09-19 15:45: a Friday update:
  - the midterm time and place is now official. See the announcement on Quercus about where and when. (For your safety, I am not posting the time or place here.) I am hoping the Quercus announcement will also answer a lot of your questions about the exam.
  - [worksheet 3](worksheet_3_c32_q.html) questions are up on the [worksheets page](all_worksheets.qmd). Most of this should be doable now if you want to get started.
  - the question file for Assignment 1 (on Quercus) was not displaying properly, but now it is (though it should not have affected reading the questions).

- 2025-09-17 20:15: worksheet 2 solutions on the [worksheets page](all_worksheets.qmd). Assignment 1 should now be open.

- 2025-09-15 11:30: Monday update:
  - Lectures this week:
    - the last bit of "numerical summaries" (the stuff with `across`)
    - choosing things in dataframes. This is long, so will probably take us the rest of the week.
  - Worksheet 2 for tutorial on Wednesday is on the [worksheets page](all_worksheets.qmd). Answers will be available after tutorial.
  - "Grades" for "Assignment 0" are posted. If you got less than 1/1, read the comment and try again.
  - Assignment 1 opens on Wed night, and is due next Monday night (Sep 22). If you have an accommodation for extended time on assignments and want to use it, claim it before the original due date. There are no other extensions. (Remember, I count only the six best assignments; this is everybody's accommodation for life events that prevent them from doing their best work.)
  - I have a provisional midterm date; I will let you know when it is official.

- 2025-09-12 13:45: next week's worksheet questions are up on the [worksheet page](all_worksheets.qmd). Answers will be available after tutorial next week.

- 2025-09-11 22:00: a late-night Thursday update:
  - I'll pick up the last bit of numerical summaries again in lecture on Tuesday. There are probably some things there that don't make much sense yet.
  - I've taken a look at the "Assignment 0" that were submitted. If you got 1 point, it means you got something relevant that illustrates you followed the instructions in Worksheet 1 and you know how to hand in an assignment in this course. If you got 0 points from handing in something, there was a problem that you need to sort out before you hand in the real thing, and you have a comment indicating what the problem might be (at least if you got reasonably close). If you didn't hand in anything, well, that's up to you, but don't expect too much sympathy if you have trouble handing in Assignment 1 when it is due. The marks don't count for anything here (which is why "Assignment 0" had scare quotes around it); the point is to do this practice now so that you have one less thing to worry about when Assignment 1 is due. If you got 0 here, it's probably a good idea to try again following the instructions in Worksheet 1; I will look in again in a few days. (You have unlimited attempts, so keep trying until you figure it out.)

- 2025-09-08 13:00: Monday update:
  - Lectures this week:
    - [Drawing graphs](http://ritsokiguess.site/lecture-notes/graphs_c32.html)
    - [Numerical summaries](http://ritsokiguess.site/lecture-notes/numsum.html)
    
    That is to say, we will be thinking about not only how to get these, but also how to interpret them (and what they tell us about our data).
  - Tutorials start this week (so make sure you are registered in one). You'll be working on [Worksheet 1](worksheet_1_c32_a.html), with a TA around to help you if you get stuck. This worksheet comes with answers (because the goal is for you to see what to do); later worksheets will *not* come with answers, because the struggle is part of the process (but the TAs will have the answers if you want to check after you have done some thinking for yourself). I will post the worksheet answers on Wed nights, on the [worksheets page](all_worksheets.qmd).
  - Looking ahead: the first assignment opens *next* week, and will be based on the material in worksheets 1 and 2. Assignments will be due on Monday night, with the first one due on Mon Sep 22. After the first assignment, assignment $n$ will be based on worksheet $n + 1$.

- 2025-09-04 13:30: 
  - If you want to get ahead of the game, here's [next week's worksheet](worksheet_1_c32_a.html) that you'll be working on in tutorial next week.
  - Some people reported to me that they couldn't get `file.choose` to work for finding files on their computer. If this happens to you:
    - make sure you have created a new project (that is associated with a folder) with a name like `STAC32`.
    - Open any files you want to work with, from wherever they are (eg `Downloads`), and "save as", saving them in your project folder (eg `STAC32`)
    - Then you can read them into R using eg. `read_csv` with a filename, as I was doing in class.
  - Hint: if the data you want to read in is on the web somewhere, use `read_csv` and friends with the URL, rather than downloading the file to your computer. It is sometimes a good idea to look at the file in your web browser first (for example, you are not sure what the data values are separated by), but you should not need to download it. (Exception: if the file is an Excel spreadsheet that you want to read in with `read_excel`. In that case, you *do* have to download it.)

- 2025-09-04 10:30: some data files for today's class:
  - [test1.xlsx](test1.xlsx)
  - [test1.csv](test1.csv)
  - [coffee.txt](coffee.txt)
  - [migraine.txt](migraine.txt)
  - [test2.xlsx](test2.xlsx)

- 2025-09-01 17:20: we begin tomorrow. Here's the lecture schedule for this week:
  - Tuesday: syllabus highlights, running R
  - Thursday: reading data files.
  
  We might start on making graphs this week. (edit: we didn't.)



- 2025-08-20 15:30: link to [planned course schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11KZFdNBysLUyXEPPTfImqTkLGOuzB3nUO9WaRLoCFfo/edit?usp=sharing), to be updated as we go.

- 2025-08-20 14:30: updates:
  - if you are in your 4th year of study (by credits completed) and joined the waitlist before today, you should be able to get into STAC32 this fall (and thus complete the program).
  - otherwise, unfortunately we do not have the resources to enlarge the class to accommodate you, so you will have to take your chances with the waitlist.
  - (edited Aug 21) for those that have applied to the program this summer: 
    - Applications are now closed. The next application period ends next May.
    - I don't even get to see the applications until August 28, so do not expect to hear a decision until after then. I plan to get to this, and convey my decisions to the Registrar's office, as soon as possible. 
    - If there are any students in there that are in their 4th year of study, I *may* be able to squeeze them into STAC32 this fall. 
    - Students who have applied this summer and who are in earlier years of study will definitely not be able to take STAC32 this fall and will have to wait a year to complete the program. I realize that this is not the best news, but unfortunately (as I said above) we cannot enlarge STAC32 further this year. 
    - The decision on your application might be slower if you are taking a program requirement course in the summer, because I am then waiting for your course instructor to submit grades for that course before I can make a decision.
  - I am about to open up the Quercus page, but (as it says below the bad picture of me) I will only be using that for assignments and marks. News will be here through the course.

- 2025-07-29 13:00: time to open things up for the fall 2025 edition of this course:
  - I'm aware that there is a long waitlist for this course. The problem is that the department literally does not have resources to make the course any bigger (for example, there is literally no-one to teach another section). Thus, if you are not already in this course, you will need to take your chances with the waitlist. I advise you to have backup plans. For example, if you are in your 3rd or earlier year of study according to your Degree Explorer, you may have to wait until next year to take STAC32 and STAD29. Appealing to me about this *will not help you*.
  - Other things:
    - [Syllabus](https://ritsokiguess.site/lecture-notes/outline_c32.html) and [detailed course policies](https://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/policies.pdf). You are expected to *attend lectures*, *take notes*, and *cite any help you get from outside the course*. (The problems you see on assignments and exams will in any case be solvable with the course materials and your brain.)
    - I will be checking prerequisites. To take STAC32, you *must* have completed (by the time STAC32 starts in September) either STAB27 or PSYC08 or MGEB12, or another equivalent *that has already been approved by me*. If you have not completed one of these courses by then, you will be removed from STAC32.
