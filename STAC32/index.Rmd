# Applications of Statistical Methods

Welcome to the home page for STAC32. This is the place to look for all things
course-related (notes, assignments, announcements etc., linked above) except for
assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca).

This is an applied course. Expect to be describing the process by which you got
your answers, and explaining what the answers mean *in the context of the data
you are working with*: that is to say, using your language skills as well as
your statistical skills. Be prepared to show your understanding and insight;
this course is about a lot more than "getting the answer". 

In real life, people
do Statistics to make decisions or inform actions, and you will be expected to
play your full part in that process, both in this course and in your statistical
future.

## News (most recent at the top):

- 2024-08-29 14:30: there is indeed a fourth tutorial:
  - Since there has been some last-minute reorganization, tutorials start in *week 2* this year. This means that some of the early worksheets (and therefore assignments) will be a bit behind what appears in the lectures, but we will catch up as we go. The first worksheet should actually be doable after the very first lecture, so I will make sure it's up in case you want to start on it right away. It looks as if there will be eight assignments this year (the first one will be due after week 3), of which the best six will count. 
  - If you are still on the waitlist, it's up to you to register yourself for the new LEC02. Also, if you are in LEC01 but would rather be in LEC02, you should be able to move to that section.

- 2024-08-28 14:20: there will soon be a fourth tutorial (on Wednesday in BV 498, like the others, is the plan). It doesn't matter which lecture section you are in; the tutorials are all good for both sections.

- 2024-08-27 11:40: we have a second lecture section, and there should be space in it for everyone on the waitlist as of right now:
  - the lectures for LEC02 (taught by me as well) are Tu 15:00-16:00 and Th 17:00-18:00
  - if you are currently on the waitlist, you can sign up for LEC02 right away
  - there will be tutorial space for everyone on Wed (it doesn't matter which tutorial you are in, because the two lecture sections will run in parallel). Expect a fourth tutorial to be created soon. You have (I think) the option to switch tutorials, up to a certain date. Since things are in a chaotic state right now, I may switch the tutorials back to starting in week 2 (and not what I said on August 12).
  - Acorn will tell you the locations of everything. 
  - The times for LEC01 are unchanged.
  - if you are currently in LEC01 and want to switch to LEC02, you can do that, which would allow people on the waitlist/in LEC02 to switch to LEC01 if that suits them better.

- 2024-08-23 15:45: breaking news: we are seeing whether we can open a second section of this course. This is contingent on being able to find a classroom to hold it in at a time that those of you on the waitlist (and I) can manage, which (as is usually the case at UTSC) is the biggest part of the problem. Expect more news early next week. (If need be, we will also hold a second section of STAD29, so there will be room in any case in that course for everyone that makes it through STAC32.)

- 2024-08-12 12:00:
  - A reminder that the course is full because the lecture room is full, and so I cannot admit any more students even if I wanted to.
  - The [course outline](https://ritsokiguess.site/lecture-notes/outline_c32.html#/title-slide), so that you can get a sense of what to expect.
  - Highlights:
    - lectures on Tuesday and Thursday (1 hour each)
    - tutorial on Wednesday in a computer lab, **starting in week 1**. In tutorial, you get a worksheet to work through using R with TA help if you get stuck. The first worksheet takes you through things from the very beginning and comes with answers, including a practice assignment hand-in. Later worksheets don't come with answers (so you have to work it out yourself), but I will publish answers after each week's tutorials are done.
    - tutorial worksheets prepare you for the assignments.
    - assignments are due weekly on Mondays and open the previous Wednesday night (the first one opens in week 2 and is due the Monday of week 3), on the same material that the previous worksheet was on. Your assignment answers will need to show code, output, and explanation of the results. (The practice assignment shows you what is needed.) I publish complete solutions after each assignment has been handed in.
    - if you do your own work on the worksheets, this will help you for the assignments; if you do your own work on the assignments, this will help you on the exams and will thus help your course grade.
    - there will be one out-of-class midterm on a date to be announced, around halfway through the course.
    - there will be a final exam, also on a date to be announced, during the final exam period.
    - exams are handwritten with short-answer questions, some of which may ask you to write code. Exams are open-book, but bear in mind that you need to organize what you bring, or else you will run out of time trying to find things.
    - the course materials (and your brain) will contain everything you need to succeed in this course, except for a few places where I ask you to find something out.

- 2024-07-29 10:45: 
  - I have found space for a few more students in the course, and have asked for these students to be added. Once this is done, the course will be *full*, since we will be at maximum capacity for our lecture room and I am not allowed to enlarge the class any further.
  - In the next couple of days, you will see either that you have been enrolled in the course or that you have moved up the waitlist. A warning that the waitlist in this class historically moves very slowly, so if you are still on the waitlist after this, I advise you to make backup plans for your courses.
  - The waitlist is long, so I had to make some choices about who to admit. Since STAC32 and STAD29 are two of the last courses in the Statistics Applied Minor program, I prioritized those students in the program who are closest to graduating, on the basis that this may be their last year, whereas students who are further from graduating can take these courses next year. This is based on the number of credits that each student will have completed by the end of the summer (assuming they pass any summer courses), with the students on the waitlist ranked from greatest to least. If you are in your 3rd year of study (as determined by UTSC), you need to be very close to the 14.0 credits that will make you 4th year to get in this time (if you don't, you will have a higher priority next year).
  - You can find your total number of credits in your Degree Explorer: under Degree and Completed Credits you will see something like 17.00/20.00 (includes 7.00 In Progress). This student will have 17.0 credits *once they have completed the courses they are now enrolled in*, and thus they have $17-7 = 10$ credits completed now and are in their 3rd year of study.
  - My decision of students to enrol is final and is not open to appeal, and, as I say, the course is full once these students are enrolled because the lecture room is full.

- 2024-06-28 19:00: time to open things up for the fall 2024 edition of this course:
  - I'm aware that the course is filling up fast. After the 3rd years have had a chance to enrol, I will look more carefully at who is on the waitlist, with the aim of making sure that those who really need the course are able to take it, subject to space being available. My priority order is: students in the Statistics Applied Minor program, and within those, students in the fourth year of study (or beyond) as calculated by UTSC, then students in earlier years of study in the program, and then students in other programs. Appealing directly to me will not change that.
  - There are (COVID-era old) recordings of the lecture material. Things have changed since they were made, but they will be available in case you must miss an occasional lecture (for example, you are sick). They are *not* a substitute for routinely missing lecture; if you do that, you risk missing important material and thereby hurting your grade.
  - I will be checking prerequisites. To take STAC32, you *must* have completed (by the time STAC32 starts in September) either STAB27 or PSYC08 or MGEB12. If you have not completed one of these courses by then, you will be removed from STAC32.
  - Looking ahead to next winter's STAD29: my aim is to make sure that there will be enough space in that course for everyone that wants to take it (and has completed STAC32).
