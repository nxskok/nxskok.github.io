# Applications of Statistical Methods

## Ken Butler

Welcome to the home page for STAC32. This is the place to look for all things
course-related (notes, assignments, announcements etc., linked above) except for
assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca).

This is an applied course. Expect to be describing the process by which you got
your answers, and explaining what the answers mean *in the context of the data
you are working with*: that is to say, using your language skills as well as
your statistical skills. Be prepared to show your understanding and insight;
this course is about a lot more than "getting the answer". 

In real life, people
do Statistics to make decisions or inform actions, and you will be expected to
play your full part in that process, both in this course and in your statistical
future.

## News (most recent at the top):

- 2025-07-29 13:00: time to open things up for the fall 2025 edition of this course:
  - I'm aware that there is a long waitlist for this course. The problem is that the department literally does not have resources to make the course any bigger (for example, there is literally no-one to teach another section). Thus, if you are not already in this course, you will need to take your chances with the waitlist. I advise you to have backup plans. For example, if you are in your 3rd or earlier year of study according to your Degree Explorer, you may have to wait until next year to take STAC32 and STAD29. Appealing to me about this *will not help you*.
  - Other things:
    - [Syllabus](https://ritsokiguess.site/lecture-notes/outline_c32.html) and [detailed course policies](https://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/policies.pdf). You are expected to *attend lectures*, *take notes*, and *cite any help you get from outside the course*. (The problems you see on assignments and exams will in any case be solvable with the course materials and your brain.)
    - I will be checking prerequisites. To take STAC32, you *must* have completed (by the time STAC32 starts in September) either STAB27 or PSYC08 or MGEB12, or another equivalent *that has already been approved by me*. If you have not completed one of these courses by then, you will be removed from STAC32.
