This is the place to look for all things course-related (notes, assignments, announcements etc., linked above) except for assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on Quercus.\nThis is an applied course. Expect to be describing the process by which you got your answers, and explaining what the answers mean in the context of the data you are working with: that is to say, using your language skills as well as your statistical skills. Be prepared to show your understanding and insight; this course is about a lot more than “getting the answer”.\nIn real life, people do Statistics to make decisions or inform actions, and you will be expected to play your full part in that process, both in this course and in your statistical future.\n\n\n\n\n2025-08-20 15:30: link to planned course schedule, to be updated as we go.\n2025-08-20 14:30: updates:\n\nif you are in your 4th year of study (by credits completed) and joined the waitlist before today, you should be able to get into STAC32 this fall (and thus complete the program).\notherwise, unfortunately we do not have the resources to enlarge the class to accommodate you, so you will have to take your chances with the waitlist.\n(edited Aug 21) for those that have applied to the program this summer:\n\nApplications are now closed. The next application period ends next May.\nI don’t even get to see the applications until August 28, so do not expect to hear a decision until after then. I plan to get to this, and convey my decisions to the Registrar’s office, as soon as possible.\nIf there are any students in there that are in their 4th year of study, I may be able to squeeze them into STAC32 this fall.\nStudents who have applied this summer and who are in earlier years of study will definitely not be able to take STAC32 this fall and will have to wait a year to complete the program. I realize that this is not the best news, but unfortunately (as I said above) we cannot enlarge STAC32 further this year.\nThe decision on your application might be slower if you are taking a program requirement course in the summer, because I am then waiting for your course instructor to submit grades for that course before I can make a decision.\n\nI am about to open up the Quercus page, but (as it says below the bad picture of me) I will only be using that for assignments and marks. News will be here through the course.\n\n2025-07-29 13:00: time to open things up for the fall 2025 edition of this course:\n\nI’m aware that there is a long waitlist for this course. The problem is that the department literally does not have resources to make the course any bigger (for example, there is literally no-one to teach another section). Thus, if you are not already in this course, you will need to take your chances with the waitlist. I advise you to have backup plans. For example, if you are in your 3rd or earlier year of study according to your Degree Explorer, you may have to wait until next year to take STAC32 and STAD29. Appealing to me about this will not help you.\nOther things:\n\nSyllabus and detailed course policies. You are expected to attend lectures, take notes, and cite any help you get from outside the course. (The problems you see on assignments and exams will in any case be solvable with the course materials and your brain.)\nI will be checking prerequisites. To take STAC32, you must have completed (by the time STAC32 starts in September) either STAB27 or PSYC08 or MGEB12, or another equivalent that has already been approved by me. If you have not completed one of these courses by then, you will be removed from STAC32.\nProgram FAQ."

    "text": "My exams come with a booklet of questions (with space to write your answers). In the exam, there are references to Figures which are in a separate booklet (in the column Figures below). Print that out, or otherwise have it available as you work through each exam.\nHere are old midterm and final exams going back to 2015. You will notice that the best way of doing things has changed over time. Be guided by how things are done now rather than in the past. (The missing years are COVID, of course.)\nI now teach R only in my courses. 2018 was the first year that I started with R and finished with SAS. Before that, I did R and SAS both for each statistical technique. Thus, for example, you will see some SAS in old midterms, which you won’t see now. Make allowances for this.\nOne of the most effective ways to find out whether you know something is to answer questions on it. (Another way is to explain it to someone else.) Thus, your best use of these exams is to do them under exam conditions without looking at the solutions, and then look at the solutions and grade yourself. This is the fastest way to find out what you don’t understand. Read through your notes and work through examples on what you missed, then tackle another exam.\nI would recommend starting with last year’s exams (the most similar to the exams you’ll see) and working backwards.\nIf all you do is read through the solutions, you have wasted a huge learning opportunity, because you will not be prepared to deal with what you face on exam day.\n2024-10-28 22:50: The 2017 midterm has been “2024-ified”, with all the SAS removed and R questions inserted in their place. It took me a long time, so don’t expect the same treatment for the previous midterms. The 2018 midterm was all R anyway, so you can attempt that one as is."
