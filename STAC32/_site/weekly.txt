weekly plan for students:

- Monday:
  - (if there was an assignment due Sunday night) read through my solutions to the assignment you just handed in, and read through your graded assignment when you get it back, paying  particular attention to the comments. 
- Tuesday: 
  - watch Tuesday's lecture (the odd-numbered one for the week). This should be up by about lunchtime.
  - start work on the PASIAS problems from the lecture 
- Wednesday: 
  - see where you are having trouble with material from Tuesday's and last Thursday's lectures (after week 1), or with the PASIAS problems
  - bring these questions to tutorial. Be prepared to share your screen so that we can see where you got to.
- Thursday:
  - watch Thursday's lecture, which should be up around lunchtime
  - if you have time, start work on the PASIAS problems from the lecture
- Friday through Sunday: 
  - pick a three-hour time-slot to work on the week's assignment.
  - the assignment becomes available on Friday at 00:01, and is due on Sunday at 11:59pm
  - once you start the assignment, you have 3 hours to complete it. Don't open the assignment until you plan to work on it!
