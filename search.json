    "text": "This course is relatively new, and the old exams don’t go back very far. If you want more practice, especially for midterms, you can try the STAC32 old exam page.\nMy exams come with a booklet of questions (with space to write your answers). In the exam, there are references to Figures which are in a separate booklet (in the column Figures below). Print that out, or otherwise have it available as you work through each exam.\nHere are the old midterm and final exams that I have. You will notice that the best way of doing things has changed over time. Be guided by how things are done now rather than in the past.\nOne of the most effective ways to find out whether you know something is to answer questions on it. (Another way is to explain it to someone else.) Thus, your best use of these exams is to do them under exam conditions without looking at the solutions, and then look at the solutions and grade yourself. This is the fastest way to find out what you don’t understand. Read through your notes and work through examples on what you missed, then tackle another exam.\nIf all you do is read through the solutions, you have wasted a huge learning opportunity, because you will not be prepared to deal with what you face on exam day."

    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions about the Applied Statistics Minor program",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Applied Statistics Minor and Statistics Minor are two very different programs, intended for students with different preparations:\n\nthe Applied Statistics Minor is for students who have taken STAB22 and STAB27 (or an equivalent pair of courses such as PSYB07 & PSYC08, or MGEB11 & MGEB12), with a relatively limited mathematical background. The program is based on a conceptual and computational (with software) approach to the subject matter, and you will be expected to explain and justify your answers.\nthe Statistics Minor is for students who have taken STAB52 and STAB57 and who thus have a background in calculus. This program is based on mainly theoretical understanding of statistical methods, but a student who completes this program should be able to develop the practical skills needed in the real world.\n\nThe choice between programs therefore depends on which introductory Statistics courses you took.\nIf you try to take the “wrong” program based on your preparation, you will run into a lot of problems with course exclusions. This is especially true if you try to take the Applied Minor when you should be taking the Minor. A consequence of this is that you may end up with too few distinct credits to graduate. (Excluded courses, ones marked Extra on your transcript and in Degree Explorer, do not count as distinct credits.)\nSpecific questions you might have are listed below.\n\nHow long does it take? Two academic years. Suggested timetable:\n\n\nacademic year 1 fall: STAB22 or equivalent, CSCA20\nyear 1 winter: STAB27 or equivalent (PSYC08 and MGEB12 are sometimes offered in the summer)\nyear 2 fall: STAC32, STAC53\nyear 2 winter: STAD29\nas offered: your courses for the last requirement.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between STAB22, STAB23, PSYB07, and MGEB11? These are all first Statistics courses aimed at students with relatively little mathematics. PSYB07 and MGEB11 are intended for students in psychology and economics for management respectively. STAB23 is intended for students in the social sciences. STAB22 is for everybody else. I only recommend taking PSYB07, MGEB11, or STAB23 if you are in one of the programs that uses those courses specifically; you will find that those courses use examples from psychology, economics and the social sciences (respectively), and so if you are studying something else, you will find the course material confusing, and you do better to take the more general STAB22 (whose examples are from a variety of fields).\nWhich second Statistics course should I take? Take the one that matches the first course you took: if you took PSYB07, take PSYC08; if you took MGEB11, take MGEB12; if you took STAB22 or STAB23, take STAB27. You may be able to take mis-matching courses, but if you do, you may find that material you need in your second course includes things you did not do in your first course.\nMy Degree Explorer says that I need STAC50, which I cannot get into, but the program requirements say STAC53. What should I do? You should take STAC53, and you should also email me with your student number so that I can change your Degree Explorer for you.\nCan I take STAB27 and STAC32 out of order to complete the program quicker? No. Prerequisites are enforced and you will be removed from STAC32 if you enrol. The same applies if you try to take STAD29 without having taken STAC32. Read the prerequisites carefully. The program is designed to take two academic years to complete. See question 0.\nCan I substitute other courses for STAC32, STAC53, STAD29? You can take STA 304 in place of STAC53, but otherwise no. If you want to use STA 304, you need to email me so that I can update your Degree Explorer. You should also be aware that STA 304 has a prerequisite STA 255, which itself requires a calculus course (which could be MATA33).\nI’m having trouble finding courses for requirement 5. Can I substitute something else? Maybe. The point of requirement 5 is that the two courses should have a significant quantitative component, for example actual math courses (such as calculus), actual other STA courses (STAC51 is your best bet), or a course in or near your discipline that has a significant quantitative component. PSYC09 and GGRC42 are examples of other courses I would accept. If you wish me to consider another course beyond the ones listed in the Calendar or on your Degree Explorer, email me, if necessary making your case that the course in question has a significant quantitative compenent.\nCan I take a Statistics Specialist/Major/Minor and an Applied Statistics Minor? No.\nCan I use STAB52 and/or STAB57 to satisfy any requirements for the Applied Statistics Minor? No. You should be taking the Statistics Minor instead.\nI have taken MATA32 and MAT33, and also MGEB11 and MGEB12. Can I take the Applied Statistics Minor? Yes.\nI have taken, or plan to take, MATA30/A31 and MATA36/37. Should I take the Applied Statistics Minor? No. The Statistics Minor is a better fit for you.\nI have taken other first-year calculus courses, such as MATA29. Can I take the Applied Statistics Minor? If you want. You will need to take STAB22 (or equivalent) and STAB27 (or equivalent).\nI am taking a Computer Science Minor. Can I also take the Applied Statistics Minor? Yes.\nI am in Statistics Specialist, Major, Minor, or the Math Specialist, Statistics Stream. Can I also take the Applied Statistics Minor, or any of STAC32, STAC53, STAD29 for credit? No and no.\nI have questions about the Statistics Minor. Can I ask you? No. Email the Supervisor of Studies for that program.\nI want to learn some SAS. Will I be learning that in any of your courses? No, not as they are currently arranged, but you might find this site useful. You will probably recognize the data sets used there, if you have taken any of my courses."

This is the place to look for things course-related (notes, code, old exams etc., linked above) except for lecture videos, assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on Quercus.\n\n\n\n\n2023-12-08 14:30: here is this year’s version of the site. Class meets once a week for two hours, starting on Wed January 10, 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n2023-05-01 20:15: I have calculated the course grades you earned, and will submit them shortly. When they have been submitted and approved, they will come to you. Some things I need to say:\n\nSome of the work done on the final exam was very good, and there will be several A+ grades.\nI was rather generous in marking the final exam.\nI have reviewed grades close to key grade boundaries and am happy that I have things in the right places.\nCourse grades are based only on the work you have done and the understanding you have displayed.\n\nYour personal circumstances do not, and cannot, figure into your grade. It does not matter how hard you worked, or that you need a certain grade for a scholarship or to graduate. If you want those things, it is up to you to do work of sufficient quality to earn them.\nIf you don’t like your grade, you have exactly two options: a clerical check and, after obtaining a copy of your marked exam, a petition for re-reading of your final exam. Note that I use R to calculate course grades, so it is very unlikely that they are incorrectly calculated.\nContacting me about your grade is not one of your options, and to do so is a waste of your time. Doing so may also contravene the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters; for example, if you ask for a grade you did not earn, you are asking me to commit an offence under B.I.3(a) on your behalf.\n\nIt is no longer possible to appeal any course work, such as assignments or the midterm.\nEnjoy your summer!\n\n2023-05-01 17:30: the exams are marked! Next thing, maybe tonight, is course grades.\n2023-04-30 22:55: into the last question, with 6(b) now being done, and I am 88% done. Four more parts of question 6 for tomorrow. My solutions as they stand now. I guess the terrible weather helped this weekend; I didn’t exactly feel like going outside and doing anything.\n2023-04-29 22:45: out of juice at the end of day 4. I am now 69% done, but that’s a bit of a cheat because I sped through 5(a) and the one-point 5(b) just now to get something done, having gotten bogged down on 4(d). I don’t like leaving questions half-done, but I will go back to it tomorrow and be as consistent as I can with what I was able to do today. Crowdmark tells me that I have over 3,000 question parts to read through altogether, of which I am now done just over 2,000. (Tonight, I had to resort to randomly sampling mp3 files from my music collection; what came up while I was working on question 5 was Mozart’s piano concerto no. 24, one of my favourites.) My solutions as they stand now.\n2023-04-28 23:50: day 3. I powered through 3(h) just now so that I could say I’m 50% done (which I am, exactly). I guess that means three more days of marking, plus getting course grades together. The laptop-on-couch method seems to be working well.\n2023-04-27 23:15: day 2, and I am now up to 32% done. My solutions so far. I have done all of the first two questions plus 3(a) and 3(e) from the long discriminant analysis question. It seems to be much quicker marking if I do it on my laptop sitting on the couch (!), minimizing the comments on the exams themselves and putting relevant comments in my solutions.\n2023-04-26 23:30: day 1 of exam marking. I am done through question 2(a), which makes me 15% done. I had an exam in my other course yesterday, so couldn’t get started until today. I am updating my solutions as I go with other things I notice, and will share them with you later.\n2023-04-23 12:00: reminder that the final exam is tomorrow, Monday April 24, at 9:00am in HW 216.\n2023-04-18 14:30: I have office hours tomorrow, Wed 19th, 11:00am-12:00pm and 2:00-3:00pm or longer if needed. There are two parts to the office hours in case you have an exam in one of them.\n2023-04-17 15:45: the final exam has been sent for printing. For those that care about such things: it has 6 questions on 9 pages, with a total of 34 parts worth a total of 84 points. The guideline is therefore 5 minutes per part or 2 minutes per point. The exam rules are the same as for the midterm (and, indeed, for all my exams): bring whatever you think may be helpful, but you will need to be able to quickly find what you are looking for in whatever you bring.\n2023-04-14 11:45: assignments 7 and 8 have been marked. Appeals, usual process, Apr 17-20.\n2023-04-09 13:00: happy Easter all. Here is a worksheet on the last week’s material. I remembered I had an old map problem that hasn’t made it into PASIAS yet, so I thought I would share it with you.\n2023-04-05 16:10:\n\nit seems that I forgot to release marks for assignment 6. This I am about to do now. Appeals by usual process between Apr 7 and Apr 13 inclusive.\nAssignments 7 and 8 will be released when marked.\nMy solutions to Assignment 8.\n\n2023-03-29 20:30:\n\nMy solutions to Assignment 7.\nPlan for next week’s lecture: principal components (part 1), drawing maps (part 2). The latter seems like a fun way to end the course.\n\n2023-03-23 11:30: My solutions to Assignment 6.\n2023-03-20 20:45: the help desk folks eventually sorted me out, but not in time for tutorial. I feel bad about this, so I made some recordings of the problems from PASIAS that I would have talked about in tutorial, and as soon as Zoom has finished processing them, I’ll share them with you:\n\nMANOVA example with Australian athletes (and a very shaky transcript).\nrepeated measures example with rats and drinking water. The videos are about 15 mins each. (added 2023-03-22 13:30: if you need a passcode, this one should work: 1XrqhB=2*B starting at the 1 and ending at the B.)\n\n2023-03-20 16:10: sorry, folks, I’m not able to connect to zoom. (I got a new phone, which is apparently not set up for 2-factor authentication to get into zoom.)\n2023-03-20 13:15: we are running out of weeks! Here’s what I plan to talk about the rest of the way:\n\nthe rest of repeated measures\ndiscriminant analysis\ncluster analysis\nmaps / principal components / frequency tables as time permits.\n\nI have, as is usually the way, more stuff that I would like to talk about than we have weeks left, so the above seems like a decent compromise. Also, I am planning 8 assignments, so the last two should be due Mar 26 and Apr 2, with nothing due in the last week.\n2023-03-15 13:15:\n\nyour midterm mark should be up on Quercus. If you wrote the midterm, please check that your mark is there, and email me if it is not. I want to make sure that I have everybody.\nlecture today:\n\na second example of multivariate ANOVA\nrepeated measures\n\nPASIAS for these:\n\nchapter 32 for MANOVA, eg problem 32.2 (solution in 32.5)\nchapter 33 for repeated measures, eg problem 33.2 (solution in 33.8)\n\n\n2023-03-11 21:45:\n\nthe midterm is graded! I am about to release the marks, and also those of assignment 5, which I apparently forgot to do. Appeals on both by the usual procedure between March 18 and 25 inclusive.\nexam stats, out of 57: Q1 34 (59%), median 41 (71%), Q3 45 (79%). These are very much in line with typical values for this course.\nI have been (a) as consistent and (b) as generous as I reasonably can in grading the midterm. It is therefore at least as likely that your midterm mark will go down rather than up if you appeal (I may easily see somewhere where I have been too generous), and if you think I have graded you harshly somewhere, you can be confident that the same work earned the same grade for everybody there.\nThere was a lot of good work, and some very nice answers that displayed clear understanding.\nMy midterm solutions.\nYou will be getting an email from Crowdmark with your graded exam. Read through this and my solutions to see what you did well and where you could have done better.\n\n2023-03-10 22:30: grading has now reached the dizzying heights of 91%. Just 5(a) and (d) to go. I didn’t have the brain cells for 5(a) today.\n2023-03-09 23:45: after I combed through the various different ways people had of doing it, 4(c) is now done, and I am 73% done, and ready for bed. My solutions have been updated with my additional grading comments from today.\n2023-03-08 22:45: reached my limit for tonight. I have marked through question 3(a), which makes me now 45% done. I have a feeling 3(b) will be an adventure, but question 4 (the coding one) ought to be quick going to mark. My midterm solutions as they stand now (with additional comments added while grading).\n2023-03-07 23:10: progress report: around my lecture in my other course, and grading some of that exam, I have now completed 1(e) and have made a first pass at 1(f), namely the answers that looked like what I was expecting. Tomorrow I will make a call about the rest. I am currently 24% done.\n2023-03-06 22:45: the midterm was scanned late this afternoon, so this evening I have made a start on grading it. I have graded 1(a) through 1(c), and I am now apparently 14% done. (This feels rather like being at the gym, where you set up a certain workout, and it tells you what percentage of the way through you are so far, and you keep going because mainly you want it to be over.)\n2023-03-06 13:00: Monday update:\n\nno tutorial today (as below)\nlecture this week: analysis of covariance, multivariate ANOVA.\nAssignment 6 will be due on Mar 19 (so you get an extra week off). There should be 8 assignments altogether.\nPASIAS:\n\nANOVA review chapter 30. Problems 30.3 through 30.6 are about contrasts. There seem to be a lot of those.\nAnalysis of covariance chapter 31.\nMultivariate ANOVA chapter 32.\n\n\n2023-03-06 09:00: no tutorial today. I will need to be either marking your exam, or marking my other exam, or preparing for one or both of those things.\n2023-03-04 11:30: I am in my office, so the exam goes ahead. If you are sick, or it is truly impossible for you to get to campus despite your best efforts, mark yourself absent on Acorn, and the weight of your midterm goes to the final exam (course policy).\n2023-03-04 06:00: according to the campus status page, campus is open today, and so our midterm goes ahead. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going back to bed!\n2023-03-03 13:55 (edit 14:30): I tried to see whether there was a good way to reschedule our midterm, but it turns out that there isn’t. My thought was to hold it in class time on Wed, but our lecture room isn’t big enough for everybody for an exam (especially not for an open-book exam), and there are no other appropriately-sized rooms available at a time reasonably close to our class time. So the best we can do is (try) to hold the midterm tomorrow as scheduled. If it gets cancelled because campus is closed, the registrar’s office will re-schedule everything that was missed, and they will do it to minimize conflicts as they normally do. (Better to have the registrar’s office reschedule things than me, I figure.) I am expecting campus to be closed sometime tonight (added: tonight’s 7:00pm midterms are cancelled), and a decision to be made about reopening tomorrow morning.\n2023-03-03 11:15: weather report: the snowstorm is supposed to start tonight and, according to the Weather Network, it will taper off to flurries at 8:00 am tomorrow and stop snowing by 10. This means that if campus is open, our midterm goes ahead (and if campus is closed, it will be rescheduled.) Keep an eye on the campus status page. I don’t know what the plans are (and there undoubtedly are some): my guess is either that the campus opens at noon, or that the campus stays closed all day.\n2023-03-02 15:05: Campus status page. Our campus is on the right. Check before you come to campus, or before your exam if you are already here.\n2023-03-02 13:30: my solutions to assignment 5.\n2023-03-01 13:15: My slides for course review (part 2 today).\n2023-03-01 13:10: to summarize about the midterm:\n\nin-person hand-written exam in HLB 101 Saturday Mar 4, 1:00-3:00pm\nopen book: you can bring any notes or other course materials, printed. Bear in mind that what you bring needs to be organized so that you can quickly find what you’re looking for.\nexam comes with a booklet of Figures to refer to (that might contain code or output or graphs).\nquestions may ask for code to perform a task or for explanations of what you see in a Figure, or occasionally a description of the output some code will produce.\nquestions will be in similar style to what you see on assignments or old midterms.\ncoverage is all the material before reading week (up to and including simple effects in ANOVA). The new material in today’s class is not on the midterm, but will be on Assignment 6, due March 19).\nthere is no assignment due March 5, to allow you to study for the midterm, and there is likely no assignment due March 12 either.\nas I recall, the midterm now contains 5 questions with 22 parts altogether worth a total of 54 points.\nIf you are sick on midterm day (especially if it is something that other people might catch from you), do not come to the midterm. In that case, fill out an absence declaration. The weight of the midterm goes onto the final exam (no makeups: this is course policy).\n\n2023-02-24 11:30: An end-of-reading-week Friday update:\n\nDon’t forget that Assignment 5 is due on Sunday night.\nOur midterm is on Saturday March 4, 1:00-3:00pm in HLB 101. Coverage is anything up to the end of the last lecture before reading week.\nThere is a lecture this coming Wednesday on the rest of the ANOVA material, as well as analysis of covariance.\nAssignment 6 will not be due until March 12 or so (depending how long the midterm takes to mark, because I will be dividing my time between marking our midterm, marking the midterm for my other course, and putting Assignment 6 together for you).\n\n2023-02-23 11:45: Assignment 4 is graded. Appeals by the usual procedure between March 2 and March 8.\n2023-02-20 21:30: the midterm is nearly ready to go to printing. As it stands now, it has 5 questions with a total of 22 parts worth a total of 54 points. I may yet decide to modify that, however.\n2023-02-16 16:00: Apparently a Thursday update:\n\nmy solutions to Assignment 4.\nnext week is Reading Week. No tutorial or lecture.\nAssignment 5 is not due until the end of Reading Week (the 26th).\nour midterm is on March 4 (see details below). The coverage is up to including the lecture we had yesterday (that is, ANOVA up to and including simple effects). There is, according to current plans, a lecture on March 1, the material in which will not be on the midterm (but will no doubt be on the final exam). The midterm rules are as for C32, bring any course materials printed, and prepare for a handwritten in-person exam. Expect less code-writing and more interpretation and explanation than in C32, since this course is more about the statistics and less about the coding.\n\n2023-02-13 20:00: Assignment 3 has been graded. Appeals by usual process between Feb 20 and Feb 26.\n2023-02-12 12:45: there appears to be a Sunday update this week:\n\nPASIAS problems to work through from last week’s lecture: dates and times 21,2, 21.4, 21.5; survival analysis, any of the (rather long) problems in chapter 29. (In the survival analysis problems, you may see me using crossing to create dataframes of combinations of values for predictions; think about how you would use datagrid to achieve the same thing.)\nlecture this week: a short revisit of survival analysis (I raced through this last week), followed by another look at analysis of variance. Some of the ANOVA material will be familiar from C32 and B27, and some of it will be new. (Coming up after reading week are some things related to ANOVA, such as analysis of covariance, MANOVA, repeated measures, and discriminant analysis; this leads into multivariate methods where you have several response variables to analyze at once).\nAssignment 5 goes out this week, but you have until Feb 26 to get it done (see below for why).\nThe week of Feb 20-24 that includes Family Day is our Reading Week. There is no tutorial or lecture that week.\nThere is a lecture on March 1, right before our midterm. The material in this lecture will not be on the midterm, but you can be sure that it will be on the final exam, so miss it at your own risk.\nThere will be no assignment due on March 5, since you will have just written a midterm, and I will be in the middle of grading it!\n\n2023-02-08 23:30: I had a burst of activity tonight working on your Assignment 5, which it seemed needed to be due on Feb 19. This, however, is on the beginning of Reading Week (Feb 20 is Family Day), so I am making it due a week later, on Feb 26. This gives you the option of getting it done before Reading Week, or of finishing it off after Reading Week. Looking further ahead, the following Sunday is March 5, which is the weekend of our midterm, so there will be no assignment due that week either. I still have to decide whether we have an assignment due on March 12.\n2023-02-08 13:30: My solutions to assignment 3, with extra discussion about predictions.\n2023-02-08 12:00: Survival analysis slides updated.\n2023-02-06 13:00: Assignment 2 has been graded, and I am about to release the grades. Appeals by the usual procedure, between Feb 13 and 19 inclusive.\n2023-02-05 16:10: There is something funny going on with predictions from the marginaleffects package, possibly at my end (though possibly not). Some people, possibly working on jupyter or r.datatools, are getting a different layout of the result from predictions, without the values being predicted from. A look at the documentation suggests that what I’m getting is not what should be happening, and what you might be getting is what should be happening. To make things work for now, follow my suggestion in the discussion thread on Quercus, summarized here as:\n\nrun cbind(predictions(...)) instead of predictions(...) if you need to to get the predictions displayed next to the values they are predictions for\nthe column with the predictions in it might be called estimate instead; bear this in if you select the columns you want to display.\n\nWhile I figure out what is happening, you can help by contributing to the Quercus discussion thread to let me know whether your output from predictions looks like mine, or like the student’s output at the top of the thread.\n2023-02-03 11:30: Friday update:\n\nWe have a midterm date: Saturday March 4, 1:00-3:00pm in HLB 101.\nAssignment 3 due on Sunday night. You may find this one rather long. (Assignment 4 will be shorter.)\nNext week’s lecture: dates and times (part 1), survival analysis (part 2). Survival analysis is a regression-like analysis of the time until something happens; often this is of patients in hospital, and the time of admission and the time of event are recorded as dates (or dates and times), so it is as well to be able to handle dates and times.\nHint: if you’re going to watch the video lectures, watch them with the current slides. Some things have changed between when I made the videos and now, and I am expecting you to do things the new way. (The same may be true of PASIAS in places; there may be some predictions done the old way, for example).\n\n2023-02-01 20:30:\n\nI finally got around to publicizing the correct assignment solutions (in the last note).\n(edited 2023-02-03 11:40) Relevant PASIAS problems for today’s lecture are from chapter 27 (ordinal response) and chapter 28 (nominal response). I already suggested 27.3 and 27.4 for the former; you might like 28.3 and the rather large 28.4 (the data set is very big), or possibly 28.6, which is a data set you know already. (I have a feeling the predictions in 28.6 and maybe elsewhere are done the old way, not the datagrid and predictions way we saw in lecture today. R is a “moving target” sometimes, and things change faster than I can update everything. I can talk about predictions some more in tutorial on Monday if you wish, but for the assignment, do the best you can.) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 81a38e8061be51674c841a9d8b13bf8cd5959e30\n\n2023-02-01 11:55: two things:\n\nupdated logistic regression slides\nMy solutions to Assignment 2.\n\n2023-01-30 12:40: Assignment 1 has been graded, and I am about to release the marks. Appeal process is the same as for C32: you need to be able to say that there has been a mistake in the grading (disagreeing with the grader’s judgement is not enough). Window for appeals is February 6-12.\n2023-01-27 15:30: Friday update:\n\nAssignment 2 is due on Sunday.\nMy solutions to Assignment 1.\nIn lecture next week: the rest of ordinal logistic regression, and multinomial logistic regression. The distinction between these two is whether the response categories are or are not ordered. One of the problems on Assignment 3 is on ordinal logistic regression, so you might benefit from reading ahead or waiting until Wednesday to tackle it. The slides for this are all here. I recognize that Assignment 3 will be long; I will make sure that Assignment 4 is shorter.\nProblems to work through from this week’s lecture: the ones listed in the note from two days ago.\n\n2023-01-25 20:00:\n\nWe got part of the way through ordinal logistic regression in today’s abbreviated class. I glossed over some things, and will fill in the details next week.\nI hope everyone got home safely and not too slowly.\nI don’t have a worksheet for you this week, because there are lots of problems in PASIAS to work through. For example, 26.4 and the rather complex 26.5 get you into multiple logistic regression (my solutions in 26.14 and 26.15), and 27.3 and 27.4 get you into ordinal logistic regression. For 27.3, you might like to either do 27.2 first, or find out about drop_na to get rid of the missing values.\nNext week, I plan to finish what I started today, and get into multinomial logistic regression (where the response categories are not ordered). There is an Assignment 2 out now, on last week’s material, and there will be an Assignment 3 next week for which some of the material in next Wednesday’s class may be helpful to you. As I recall, Assignment 3 is on the long side, but Assignment 4 is likely to be short.\n\n2023-01-25 12:45: if you don’t make it to class today, you can watch the old lecture videos. On the lecture video page on Quercus, the ones you want are the second half of lecture 2a, and (in principle) all of lecture 2b. Next week, I will pick up from wherever I leave off today.\n2023-01-25 10:30: campus is open, and I am in my office, so class will go ahead (unless you hear otherwise). According to the last weather forecast I saw, the worst of the snow will start around 5, and we’ll be done class by then. (Added 11:45: looking out of my office window and watching the snow come down, my inclination is to only go to about 3:30 today, so that if you want to get off campus before 4, you’ll be able to do so.)\n2023-01-24 14:00: I just looked at the weather forecast for tomorrow, and it is supposed to start snowing here right when our class begins. It would probably be wise to check the campus status page before you head to campus. Sometimes UTSC pre-emptively closes campus if bad weather is forecast. If we do miss class, then it’s the same as an old-fashioned snow day; this week’s class would not be made up or taken online, and next week’s class would pick up from where we left off last week.\n2023-01-20 12:45: we seem to have a Friday update this week:\n\nMonday tutorial: bring questions, confusions etc about what’s been happening so far in the course. I can talk about worksheet 2 if that would be helpful.\nnext week’s lectures: see the Jan 18 20:40 note. You might like to read through the slides (or even watch the videos) before lecture, so that you have a sense of where we are going.\n\n2023-01-18 23:50: I have spent rather too much of my evening putting together a more suitable question for your assignment 2 (next week), one that is actually based on what we did today. This means that I already have one question ready for your assignment 3 (the one that was until tonight on assignment 2), and that will save me some time next week.\n2023-01-18 20:40:\n\na smallish worksheet for practice on what we did in class today. I realized that the second problem I put on next week’s assignment is something we didn’t really get to today, so I will be shuffling things about between now and next week to make it fairer for you. (Figuring out how far I will get in class is as much an art as a science.)\nNext week’s class begins with multiple logistic regression, where the response side still has a success/failure, but the explanatory side contains several things, like a multiple regression, and we want to figure out which ones of them to keep.\nAfter that, we have to deal with the response side having more than two categories, and this breaks up into two parts according to whether they have a natural order (like levels of severity of disease), or not (like favourite colour or brand of cellphone someone prefers). I’m expecting that we’ll get into ordered response next week.\n\n2023-01-16 11:30: on the agenda for this week:\n\nlectures: the rest of the regression stuff (part 1 on Wed), the start of logistic regression (part 2).\nAssignment 1 (just one question: there will usually be two) is posted at midnight on the beginning of Tuesday, and will be due on Sunday night.\n\n2023-01-13 12:00: There seems to be a Friday update:\n\nearlier this week I learned about a new version: click this link of the online access to R Studio, the one that you may have been accessing through jupyter.utoronto.ca. The new link has the newest version of R and R Studio, so you might like to switch to it. (The old one will continue to exist at least for a while.) If you are using R Studio on your own computer, this does not affect you at all.\nlecture code: the tab by that name on this website now links to my most up-to-date project of lecture notes, so that what you see there is consistent with what you will see in lecture, and tells you how you can get a copy for yourself should you wish to.\nI will be setting up a zoom meeting for Monday’s “tutorial”. The actual link will be shown on Quercus, since I only want it to be accessible to students in this class (and not be public).\n\n2023-01-11 11:45 (edited 2023-01-12 18:00): a worksheet to go through (for yourself) after today’s class. There is one longish question (after editing). I can’t promise that you’ll get a worksheet every week, but there didn’t seem to be a good PASIAS problem on this stuff, so you get a worksheet this week.\n2023-01-08 20:00: almost time to begin. Our first class is on Wednesday afternoon, and our first tutorial (or practical or whatever it is called) will be on Monday Jan 16. We should probably make some arrangements for that on Wednesday.\n2023-01-03 14:50: this year’s course outline.\n2022-12-31 21:30: Happy new year, everyone!\n\nThis course follows on from STAC32, and assumes mastery of the statistical and coding material you learned there. The focus here is less on the coding and more on the statistical methods. These will be almost entirely new to you, but a lot of them build on the regression and ANOVA ideas you learned in previous courses.\nThis course is cross-listed as the graduate course STA 1007. If you are enrolled in that course, you should know or be willing to learn about what was covered in STAC32 (statistical methods up to multiple regression, and R coding for them).\nThe Quercus page for this course is now up and running. If you are in STA 1007, you should get redirected to the STAD29 one.\nI suspect I will have to edit the course outline to reflect how we are doing things this year. There will be a midterm and final exam, assignments, and (for the STA 1007 people only) a project. (Last year, we were still online at this point.)"

    "text": "2023-05-01 20:15: I have calculated the course grades you earned, and will submit them shortly. When they have been submitted and approved, they will come to you. Some things I need to say:\n\nSome of the work done on the final exam was very good, and there will be several A+ grades.\nI was rather generous in marking the final exam.\nI have reviewed grades close to key grade boundaries and am happy that I have things in the right places.\nCourse grades are based only on the work you have done and the understanding you have displayed.\n\nYour personal circumstances do not, and cannot, figure into your grade. It does not matter how hard you worked, or that you need a certain grade for a scholarship or to graduate. If you want those things, it is up to you to do work of sufficient quality to earn them.\nIf you don’t like your grade, you have exactly two options: a clerical check and, after obtaining a copy of your marked exam, a petition for re-reading of your final exam. Note that I use R to calculate course grades, so it is very unlikely that they are incorrectly calculated.\nContacting me about your grade is not one of your options, and to do so is a waste of your time. Doing so may also contravene the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters; for example, if you ask for a grade you did not earn, you are asking me to commit an offence under B.I.3(a) on your behalf.\n\nIt is no longer possible to appeal any course work, such as assignments or the midterm.\nEnjoy your summer!\n\n2023-05-01 17:30: the exams are marked! Next thing, maybe tonight, is course grades.\n2023-04-30 22:55: into the last question, with 6(b) now being done, and I am 88% done. Four more parts of question 6 for tomorrow. My solutions as they stand now. I guess the terrible weather helped this weekend; I didn’t exactly feel like going outside and doing anything.\n2023-04-29 22:45: out of juice at the end of day 4. I am now 69% done, but that’s a bit of a cheat because I sped through 5(a) and the one-point 5(b) just now to get something done, having gotten bogged down on 4(d). I don’t like leaving questions half-done, but I will go back to it tomorrow and be as consistent as I can with what I was able to do today. Crowdmark tells me that I have over 3,000 question parts to read through altogether, of which I am now done just over 2,000. (Tonight, I had to resort to randomly sampling mp3 files from my music collection; what came up while I was working on question 5 was Mozart’s piano concerto no. 24, one of my favourites.) My solutions as they stand now.\n2023-04-28 23:50: day 3. I powered through 3(h) just now so that I could say I’m 50% done (which I am, exactly). I guess that means three more days of marking, plus getting course grades together. The laptop-on-couch method seems to be working well.\n2023-04-27 23:15: day 2, and I am now up to 32% done. My solutions so far. I have done all of the first two questions plus 3(a) and 3(e) from the long discriminant analysis question. It seems to be much quicker marking if I do it on my laptop sitting on the couch (!), minimizing the comments on the exams themselves and putting relevant comments in my solutions.\n2023-04-26 23:30: day 1 of exam marking. I am done through question 2(a), which makes me 15% done. I had an exam in my other course yesterday, so couldn’t get started until today. I am updating my solutions as I go with other things I notice, and will share them with you later.\n2023-04-23 12:00: reminder that the final exam is tomorrow, Monday April 24, at 9:00am in HW 216.\n2023-04-18 14:30: I have office hours tomorrow, Wed 19th, 11:00am-12:00pm and 2:00-3:00pm or longer if needed. There are two parts to the office hours in case you have an exam in one of them.\n2023-04-17 15:45: the final exam has been sent for printing. For those that care about such things: it has 6 questions on 9 pages, with a total of 34 parts worth a total of 84 points. The guideline is therefore 5 minutes per part or 2 minutes per point. The exam rules are the same as for the midterm (and, indeed, for all my exams): bring whatever you think may be helpful, but you will need to be able to quickly find what you are looking for in whatever you bring.\n2023-04-14 11:45: assignments 7 and 8 have been marked. Appeals, usual process, Apr 17-20.\n2023-04-09 13:00: happy Easter all. Here is a worksheet on the last week’s material. I remembered I had an old map problem that hasn’t made it into PASIAS yet, so I thought I would share it with you.\n2023-04-05 16:10:\n\nit seems that I forgot to release marks for assignment 6. This I am about to do now. Appeals by usual process between Apr 7 and Apr 13 inclusive.\nAssignments 7 and 8 will be released when marked.\nMy solutions to Assignment 8.\n\n2023-03-29 20:30:\n\nMy solutions to Assignment 7.\nPlan for next week’s lecture: principal components (part 1), drawing maps (part 2). The latter seems like a fun way to end the course.\n\n2023-03-23 11:30: My solutions to Assignment 6.\n2023-03-20 20:45: the help desk folks eventually sorted me out, but not in time for tutorial. I feel bad about this, so I made some recordings of the problems from PASIAS that I would have talked about in tutorial, and as soon as Zoom has finished processing them, I’ll share them with you:\n\nMANOVA example with Australian athletes (and a very shaky transcript).\nrepeated measures example with rats and drinking water. The videos are about 15 mins each. (added 2023-03-22 13:30: if you need a passcode, this one should work: 1XrqhB=2*B starting at the 1 and ending at the B.)\n\n2023-03-20 16:10: sorry, folks, I’m not able to connect to zoom. (I got a new phone, which is apparently not set up for 2-factor authentication to get into zoom.)\n2023-03-20 13:15: we are running out of weeks! Here’s what I plan to talk about the rest of the way:\n\nthe rest of repeated measures\ndiscriminant analysis\ncluster analysis\nmaps / principal components / frequency tables as time permits.\n\nI have, as is usually the way, more stuff that I would like to talk about than we have weeks left, so the above seems like a decent compromise. Also, I am planning 8 assignments, so the last two should be due Mar 26 and Apr 2, with nothing due in the last week.\n2023-03-15 13:15:\n\nyour midterm mark should be up on Quercus. If you wrote the midterm, please check that your mark is there, and email me if it is not. I want to make sure that I have everybody.\nlecture today:\n\na second example of multivariate ANOVA\nrepeated measures\n\nPASIAS for these:\n\nchapter 32 for MANOVA, eg problem 32.2 (solution in 32.5)\nchapter 33 for repeated measures, eg problem 33.2 (solution in 33.8)\n\n\n2023-03-11 21:45:\n\nthe midterm is graded! I am about to release the marks, and also those of assignment 5, which I apparently forgot to do. Appeals on both by the usual procedure between March 18 and 25 inclusive.\nexam stats, out of 57: Q1 34 (59%), median 41 (71%), Q3 45 (79%). These are very much in line with typical values for this course.\nI have been (a) as consistent and (b) as generous as I reasonably can in grading the midterm. It is therefore at least as likely that your midterm mark will go down rather than up if you appeal (I may easily see somewhere where I have been too generous), and if you think I have graded you harshly somewhere, you can be confident that the same work earned the same grade for everybody there.\nThere was a lot of good work, and some very nice answers that displayed clear understanding.\nMy midterm solutions.\nYou will be getting an email from Crowdmark with your graded exam. Read through this and my solutions to see what you did well and where you could have done better.\n\n2023-03-10 22:30: grading has now reached the dizzying heights of 91%. Just 5(a) and (d) to go. I didn’t have the brain cells for 5(a) today.\n2023-03-09 23:45: after I combed through the various different ways people had of doing it, 4(c) is now done, and I am 73% done, and ready for bed. My solutions have been updated with my additional grading comments from today.\n2023-03-08 22:45: reached my limit for tonight. I have marked through question 3(a), which makes me now 45% done. I have a feeling 3(b) will be an adventure, but question 4 (the coding one) ought to be quick going to mark. My midterm solutions as they stand now (with additional comments added while grading).\n2023-03-07 23:10: progress report: around my lecture in my other course, and grading some of that exam, I have now completed 1(e) and have made a first pass at 1(f), namely the answers that looked like what I was expecting. Tomorrow I will make a call about the rest. I am currently 24% done.\n2023-03-06 22:45: the midterm was scanned late this afternoon, so this evening I have made a start on grading it. I have graded 1(a) through 1(c), and I am now apparently 14% done. (This feels rather like being at the gym, where you set up a certain workout, and it tells you what percentage of the way through you are so far, and you keep going because mainly you want it to be over.)\n2023-03-06 13:00: Monday update:\n\nno tutorial today (as below)\nlecture this week: analysis of covariance, multivariate ANOVA.\nAssignment 6 will be due on Mar 19 (so you get an extra week off). There should be 8 assignments altogether.\nPASIAS:\n\nANOVA review chapter 30. Problems 30.3 through 30.6 are about contrasts. There seem to be a lot of those.\nAnalysis of covariance chapter 31.\nMultivariate ANOVA chapter 32.\n\n\n2023-03-06 09:00: no tutorial today. I will need to be either marking your exam, or marking my other exam, or preparing for one or both of those things.\n2023-03-04 11:30: I am in my office, so the exam goes ahead. If you are sick, or it is truly impossible for you to get to campus despite your best efforts, mark yourself absent on Acorn, and the weight of your midterm goes to the final exam (course policy).\n2023-03-04 06:00: according to the campus status page, campus is open today, and so our midterm goes ahead. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going back to bed!\n2023-03-03 13:55 (edit 14:30): I tried to see whether there was a good way to reschedule our midterm, but it turns out that there isn’t. My thought was to hold it in class time on Wed, but our lecture room isn’t big enough for everybody for an exam (especially not for an open-book exam), and there are no other appropriately-sized rooms available at a time reasonably close to our class time. So the best we can do is (try) to hold the midterm tomorrow as scheduled. If it gets cancelled because campus is closed, the registrar’s office will re-schedule everything that was missed, and they will do it to minimize conflicts as they normally do. (Better to have the registrar’s office reschedule things than me, I figure.) I am expecting campus to be closed sometime tonight (added: tonight’s 7:00pm midterms are cancelled), and a decision to be made about reopening tomorrow morning.\n2023-03-03 11:15: weather report: the snowstorm is supposed to start tonight and, according to the Weather Network, it will taper off to flurries at 8:00 am tomorrow and stop snowing by 10. This means that if campus is open, our midterm goes ahead (and if campus is closed, it will be rescheduled.) Keep an eye on the campus status page. I don’t know what the plans are (and there undoubtedly are some): my guess is either that the campus opens at noon, or that the campus stays closed all day.\n2023-03-02 15:05: Campus status page. Our campus is on the right. Check before you come to campus, or before your exam if you are already here.\n2023-03-02 13:30: my solutions to assignment 5.\n2023-03-01 13:15: My slides for course review (part 2 today).\n2023-03-01 13:10: to summarize about the midterm:\n\nin-person hand-written exam in HLB 101 Saturday Mar 4, 1:00-3:00pm\nopen book: you can bring any notes or other course materials, printed. Bear in mind that what you bring needs to be organized so that you can quickly find what you’re looking for.\nexam comes with a booklet of Figures to refer to (that might contain code or output or graphs).\nquestions may ask for code to perform a task or for explanations of what you see in a Figure, or occasionally a description of the output some code will produce.\nquestions will be in similar style to what you see on assignments or old midterms.\ncoverage is all the material before reading week (up to and including simple effects in ANOVA). The new material in today’s class is not on the midterm, but will be on Assignment 6, due March 19).\nthere is no assignment due March 5, to allow you to study for the midterm, and there is likely no assignment due March 12 either.\nas I recall, the midterm now contains 5 questions with 22 parts altogether worth a total of 54 points.\nIf you are sick on midterm day (especially if it is something that other people might catch from you), do not come to the midterm. In that case, fill out an absence declaration. The weight of the midterm goes onto the final exam (no makeups: this is course policy).\n\n2023-02-24 11:30: An end-of-reading-week Friday update:\n\nDon’t forget that Assignment 5 is due on Sunday night.\nOur midterm is on Saturday March 4, 1:00-3:00pm in HLB 101. Coverage is anything up to the end of the last lecture before reading week.\nThere is a lecture this coming Wednesday on the rest of the ANOVA material, as well as analysis of covariance.\nAssignment 6 will not be due until March 12 or so (depending how long the midterm takes to mark, because I will be dividing my time between marking our midterm, marking the midterm for my other course, and putting Assignment 6 together for you).\n\n2023-02-23 11:45: Assignment 4 is graded. Appeals by the usual procedure between March 2 and March 8.\n2023-02-20 21:30: the midterm is nearly ready to go to printing. As it stands now, it has 5 questions with a total of 22 parts worth a total of 54 points. I may yet decide to modify that, however.\n2023-02-16 16:00: Apparently a Thursday update:\n\nmy solutions to Assignment 4.\nnext week is Reading Week. No tutorial or lecture.\nAssignment 5 is not due until the end of Reading Week (the 26th).\nour midterm is on March 4 (see details below). The coverage is up to including the lecture we had yesterday (that is, ANOVA up to and including simple effects). There is, according to current plans, a lecture on March 1, the material in which will not be on the midterm (but will no doubt be on the final exam). The midterm rules are as for C32, bring any course materials printed, and prepare for a handwritten in-person exam. Expect less code-writing and more interpretation and explanation than in C32, since this course is more about the statistics and less about the coding.\n\n2023-02-13 20:00: Assignment 3 has been graded. Appeals by usual process between Feb 20 and Feb 26.\n2023-02-12 12:45: there appears to be a Sunday update this week:\n\nPASIAS problems to work through from last week’s lecture: dates and times 21,2, 21.4, 21.5; survival analysis, any of the (rather long) problems in chapter 29. (In the survival analysis problems, you may see me using crossing to create dataframes of combinations of values for predictions; think about how you would use datagrid to achieve the same thing.)\nlecture this week: a short revisit of survival analysis (I raced through this last week), followed by another look at analysis of variance. Some of the ANOVA material will be familiar from C32 and B27, and some of it will be new. (Coming up after reading week are some things related to ANOVA, such as analysis of covariance, MANOVA, repeated measures, and discriminant analysis; this leads into multivariate methods where you have several response variables to analyze at once).\nAssignment 5 goes out this week, but you have until Feb 26 to get it done (see below for why).\nThe week of Feb 20-24 that includes Family Day is our Reading Week. There is no tutorial or lecture that week.\nThere is a lecture on March 1, right before our midterm. The material in this lecture will not be on the midterm, but you can be sure that it will be on the final exam, so miss it at your own risk.\nThere will be no assignment due on March 5, since you will have just written a midterm, and I will be in the middle of grading it!\n\n2023-02-08 23:30: I had a burst of activity tonight working on your Assignment 5, which it seemed needed to be due on Feb 19. This, however, is on the beginning of Reading Week (Feb 20 is Family Day), so I am making it due a week later, on Feb 26. This gives you the option of getting it done before Reading Week, or of finishing it off after Reading Week. Looking further ahead, the following Sunday is March 5, which is the weekend of our midterm, so there will be no assignment due that week either. I still have to decide whether we have an assignment due on March 12.\n2023-02-08 13:30: My solutions to assignment 3, with extra discussion about predictions.\n2023-02-08 12:00: Survival analysis slides updated.\n2023-02-06 13:00: Assignment 2 has been graded, and I am about to release the grades. Appeals by the usual procedure, between Feb 13 and 19 inclusive.\n2023-02-05 16:10: There is something funny going on with predictions from the marginaleffects package, possibly at my end (though possibly not). Some people, possibly working on jupyter or r.datatools, are getting a different layout of the result from predictions, without the values being predicted from. A look at the documentation suggests that what I’m getting is not what should be happening, and what you might be getting is what should be happening. To make things work for now, follow my suggestion in the discussion thread on Quercus, summarized here as:\n\nrun cbind(predictions(...)) instead of predictions(...) if you need to to get the predictions displayed next to the values they are predictions for\nthe column with the predictions in it might be called estimate instead; bear this in if you select the columns you want to display.\n\nWhile I figure out what is happening, you can help by contributing to the Quercus discussion thread to let me know whether your output from predictions looks like mine, or like the student’s output at the top of the thread.\n2023-02-03 11:30: Friday update:\n\nWe have a midterm date: Saturday March 4, 1:00-3:00pm in HLB 101.\nAssignment 3 due on Sunday night. You may find this one rather long. (Assignment 4 will be shorter.)\nNext week’s lecture: dates and times (part 1), survival analysis (part 2). Survival analysis is a regression-like analysis of the time until something happens; often this is of patients in hospital, and the time of admission and the time of event are recorded as dates (or dates and times), so it is as well to be able to handle dates and times.\nHint: if you’re going to watch the video lectures, watch them with the current slides. Some things have changed between when I made the videos and now, and I am expecting you to do things the new way. (The same may be true of PASIAS in places; there may be some predictions done the old way, for example).\n\n2023-02-01 20:30:\n\nI finally got around to publicizing the correct assignment solutions (in the last note).\n(edited 2023-02-03 11:40) Relevant PASIAS problems for today’s lecture are from chapter 27 (ordinal response) and chapter 28 (nominal response). I already suggested 27.3 and 27.4 for the former; you might like 28.3 and the rather large 28.4 (the data set is very big), or possibly 28.6, which is a data set you know already. (I have a feeling the predictions in 28.6 and maybe elsewhere are done the old way, not the datagrid and predictions way we saw in lecture today. R is a “moving target” sometimes, and things change faster than I can update everything. I can talk about predictions some more in tutorial on Monday if you wish, but for the assignment, do the best you can.) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 81a38e8061be51674c841a9d8b13bf8cd5959e30\n\n2023-02-01 11:55: two things:\n\nupdated logistic regression slides\nMy solutions to Assignment 2.\n\n2023-01-30 12:40: Assignment 1 has been graded, and I am about to release the marks. Appeal process is the same as for C32: you need to be able to say that there has been a mistake in the grading (disagreeing with the grader’s judgement is not enough). Window for appeals is February 6-12.\n2023-01-27 15:30: Friday update:\n\nAssignment 2 is due on Sunday.\nMy solutions to Assignment 1.\nIn lecture next week: the rest of ordinal logistic regression, and multinomial logistic regression. The distinction between these two is whether the response categories are or are not ordered. One of the problems on Assignment 3 is on ordinal logistic regression, so you might benefit from reading ahead or waiting until Wednesday to tackle it. The slides for this are all here. I recognize that Assignment 3 will be long; I will make sure that Assignment 4 is shorter.\nProblems to work through from this week’s lecture: the ones listed in the note from two days ago.\n\n2023-01-25 20:00:\n\nWe got part of the way through ordinal logistic regression in today’s abbreviated class. I glossed over some things, and will fill in the details next week.\nI hope everyone got home safely and not too slowly.\nI don’t have a worksheet for you this week, because there are lots of problems in PASIAS to work through. For example, 26.4 and the rather complex 26.5 get you into multiple logistic regression (my solutions in 26.14 and 26.15), and 27.3 and 27.4 get you into ordinal logistic regression. For 27.3, you might like to either do 27.2 first, or find out about drop_na to get rid of the missing values.\nNext week, I plan to finish what I started today, and get into multinomial logistic regression (where the response categories are not ordered). There is an Assignment 2 out now, on last week’s material, and there will be an Assignment 3 next week for which some of the material in next Wednesday’s class may be helpful to you. As I recall, Assignment 3 is on the long side, but Assignment 4 is likely to be short.\n\n2023-01-25 12:45: if you don’t make it to class today, you can watch the old lecture videos. On the lecture video page on Quercus, the ones you want are the second half of lecture 2a, and (in principle) all of lecture 2b. Next week, I will pick up from wherever I leave off today.\n2023-01-25 10:30: campus is open, and I am in my office, so class will go ahead (unless you hear otherwise). According to the last weather forecast I saw, the worst of the snow will start around 5, and we’ll be done class by then. (Added 11:45: looking out of my office window and watching the snow come down, my inclination is to only go to about 3:30 today, so that if you want to get off campus before 4, you’ll be able to do so.)\n2023-01-24 14:00: I just looked at the weather forecast for tomorrow, and it is supposed to start snowing here right when our class begins. It would probably be wise to check the campus status page before you head to campus. Sometimes UTSC pre-emptively closes campus if bad weather is forecast. If we do miss class, then it’s the same as an old-fashioned snow day; this week’s class would not be made up or taken online, and next week’s class would pick up from where we left off last week.\n2023-01-20 12:45: we seem to have a Friday update this week:\n\nMonday tutorial: bring questions, confusions etc about what’s been happening so far in the course. I can talk about worksheet 2 if that would be helpful.\nnext week’s lectures: see the Jan 18 20:40 note. You might like to read through the slides (or even watch the videos) before lecture, so that you have a sense of where we are going.\n\n2023-01-18 23:50: I have spent rather too much of my evening putting together a more suitable question for your assignment 2 (next week), one that is actually based on what we did today. This means that I already have one question ready for your assignment 3 (the one that was until tonight on assignment 2), and that will save me some time next week.\n2023-01-18 20:40:\n\na smallish worksheet for practice on what we did in class today. I realized that the second problem I put on next week’s assignment is something we didn’t really get to today, so I will be shuffling things about between now and next week to make it fairer for you. (Figuring out how far I will get in class is as much an art as a science.)\nNext week’s class begins with multiple logistic regression, where the response side still has a success/failure, but the explanatory side contains several things, like a multiple regression, and we want to figure out which ones of them to keep.\nAfter that, we have to deal with the response side having more than two categories, and this breaks up into two parts according to whether they have a natural order (like levels of severity of disease), or not (like favourite colour or brand of cellphone someone prefers). I’m expecting that we’ll get into ordered response next week.\n\n2023-01-16 11:30: on the agenda for this week:\n\nlectures: the rest of the regression stuff (part 1 on Wed), the start of logistic regression (part 2).\nAssignment 1 (just one question: there will usually be two) is posted at midnight on the beginning of Tuesday, and will be due on Sunday night.\n\n2023-01-13 12:00: There seems to be a Friday update:\n\nearlier this week I learned about a new version: click this link of the online access to R Studio, the one that you may have been accessing through jupyter.utoronto.ca. The new link has the newest version of R and R Studio, so you might like to switch to it. (The old one will continue to exist at least for a while.) If you are using R Studio on your own computer, this does not affect you at all.\nlecture code: the tab by that name on this website now links to my most up-to-date project of lecture notes, so that what you see there is consistent with what you will see in lecture, and tells you how you can get a copy for yourself should you wish to.\nI will be setting up a zoom meeting for Monday’s “tutorial”. The actual link will be shown on Quercus, since I only want it to be accessible to students in this class (and not be public).\n\n2023-01-11 11:45 (edited 2023-01-12 18:00): a worksheet to go through (for yourself) after today’s class. There is one longish question (after editing). I can’t promise that you’ll get a worksheet every week, but there didn’t seem to be a good PASIAS problem on this stuff, so you get a worksheet this week.\n2023-01-08 20:00: almost time to begin. Our first class is on Wednesday afternoon, and our first tutorial (or practical or whatever it is called) will be on Monday Jan 16. We should probably make some arrangements for that on Wednesday.\n2023-01-03 14:50: this year’s course outline.\n2022-12-31 21:30: Happy new year, everyone!\n\nThis course follows on from STAC32, and assumes mastery of the statistical and coding material you learned there. The focus here is less on the coding and more on the statistical methods. These will be almost entirely new to you, but a lot of them build on the regression and ANOVA ideas you learned in previous courses.\nThis course is cross-listed as the graduate course STA 1007. If you are enrolled in that course, you should know or be willing to learn about what was covered in STAC32 (statistical methods up to multiple regression, and R coding for them).\nThe Quercus page for this course is now up and running. If you are in STA 1007, you should get redirected to the STAD29 one.\nI suspect I will have to edit the course outline to reflect how we are doing things this year. There will be a midterm and final exam, assignments, and (for the STA 1007 people only) a project. (Last year, we were still online at this point.)"

    "text": "My exams come with a booklet of questions (with space to write your answers). In the exam, there are references to Figures which are in a separate booklet (in the column Figures below). Print that out, or otherwise have it available as you work through each exam.\nHere are old midterm and final exams going back to 2015. You will notice that the best way of doing things has changed over time. Be guided by how things are done now rather than in the past.\nI now teach R only in my courses. 2018 was the first year that I started with R and finished with SAS. Before that, I did R and SAS both for each statistical technique. Thus, for example, you will see some SAS in old midterms, which you won’t see now. Make allowances for this.\nOne of the most effective ways to find out whether you know something is to answer questions on it. (Another way is to explain it to someone else.) Thus, your best use of these exams is to do them under exam conditions without looking at the solutions, and then look at the solutions and grade yourself. This is the fastest way to find out what you don’t understand. Read through your notes and work through examples on what you missed, then tackle another exam.\nI would recommend starting with last year’s exams (the most similar to the exams you’ll see) and working backwards.\nIf all you do is read through the solutions, you have wasted a huge learning opportunity, because you will not be prepared to deal with what you face on exam day."

    "text": "bad picture\n\n\nWelcome to the home page for STAC32. This is the place to look for all things course-related (notes, assignments, announcements etc., linked above) except for assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on Quercus.\nThis is an applied course. Expect to be describing the process by which you got your answers, and explaining what the answers mean in the context of the data you are working with: that is to say, using your language skills as well as your statistical skills. Be prepared to show your understanding and insight; this course is about a lot more than “getting the answer”.\nIn real life, people do Statistics to make decisions or inform actions, and you will be expected to play your full part in that process, both in this course and in your statistical future.\n\n\n\n\n2023-12-08 16:45:\n\nThe final exam has gone for printing. I decided to keep all the questions I had, and I think it actually adds up to exactly 100 points (I didn’t add anything).\nThe final exam is more than 50% longer than the (very short) midterm, so if you were running short of time on the midterm, be aware that you will need to be more organized for the final. (On the midterm, as far as I could tell, most people seemed to have plenty of time.)\nAs a guide, you have about 4 minutes per part and a bit less than 2 minutes per point. (Some of the parts and points will be a lot quicker than that if you are well prepared.)\nI have been tinkering with the website, to make my organization of it better. You will notice that it looks a little different. I think everything is where it should be, but if you notice anything missing, let me know.\nI will have office hours on Wednesday next week. I’m aiming to be around 11:00am to 1:00pm, so that you can still catch me if you have either a morning or an afternoon exam that day.\n\n2023-11-27 16:55: I think I am happy with the general shape of the final exam. It now has 7 questions with a total of 41 parts worth a total of 99 points. I still need to do some serious editing; I am not going to make it any longer, but it might end up being a little shorter than it is now.\n2023-11-27 11:30: into the last week of classes:\n\nI just posted an announcement on Quercus with the date, time, and location of our final exam. This is on Quercus only for security reasons (to be only accessible to people in this course).\nAssignment 7 is mostly graded and Assignment 8 is partly graded. I will release the grades when I have confirmation that the grading is done. My solutions to Assignment 8.\nWorksheet 12 for this week’s tutorial. This is rather long, to give you lots of opportunity for practice.\nLectures this week (yes, we are not done yet):\n\nTuesday: finish the multiple regression material, including regression with categorical variables.\nThursday: functions, as far as we get through that.\n\nPASIAS problems on functions.\n\n2023-11-22 21:15: There is a Worksheet 12 ready for next week, which I will share on Monday. I have also been working on our final exam, which currently has 5 questions with a total of 28 parts worth a total of 67 points. I plan to add two more questions, so that the total points is somewhere near 90. Be aware that this will be more than 50% longer than the midterm — you will need to make sure to have your materials organized so that you can work efficiently.\n2023-11-20 14:15: this is week 11 (of 12, the last lecture being on Nov 30).\n\nAssignment 7 is being graded. My solutions. Assignment 8 is due tonight, and will be the final one. (The best 6 out of your assignment scores, by percentage, will count towards your course grade.)\nLectures this week:\n\nTuesday: finish the windmill case study and start on the asphalt one (multiple regression)\nThursday: finish the asphalt case study and start on regression with categorical variables.\nThe rest of the way: I want to finish the regression stuff and talk about functions. I have some stuff about dates and times that I will probably leave until D29.\n\nWorksheet 11 on simple and multiple regression, for tutorial on Wednesday. This is rather long, and includes more material on multiple regression than we will likely get to in the Tuesday lecture, but it seemed to fit together well, and it gives you a chance to practice everything. You may prefer to leave some of it until after Thursday’s lecture.\nPASIAS problems for multiple regression, to practice after we get to that.\n\n2023-11-13 15:15: A slightly late Monday update, because I realized I got out of sync with where I expected to be, and the worksheet 10 and assignment 8 I had planned were no longer suitable. Anyway, that is now fixed, and the story is this:\n\nAssignment 6 has been graded. My solutions. Appeals by usual procedure between Nov 16 and Nov 23.\nAssignment 7 is due tonight; the final Assignment 8 opens on Wed night.\nlectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of tidying data\nThursday: simple regression (one \\(x\\)-variable; the windmill case study)\n\nWorksheet 10 for tutorial on Wed. This is rather long, but I wanted to give you some practice on various aspects of tidying data. (Assignment 8 is actually rather short.)\nPASIAS problems on simple regression, for later in the week.\n\n2023-11-11 20:00: How to get good with R, a blog post by Nick Tierney (who is good with R).\n2023-11-07 12:30: Assignment 4 is also graded. My solutions. Appeals by usual procedure between Nov 10 and Nov 17 inclusive.\n2023-11-06 13:55: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 5 is graded. My solutions. Appeals by usual procedure between Nov 9 and Nov 16 inclusive.\nthe longer Assignment 4 is about 2/3 graded. I will post the grades for that when it is finished.\nAssignment 6 due tonight; Assignment 7 opens on Wed night.\nin lecture this week: tidying data. There are about three pieces of lecture notes on this: tidying data, extras, when pivot-wider goes wrong. I intend to finish the first of those tomorrow.\nyou may have noticed that there is a lecture on writing reports. I am skipping that this time.\nWorksheet 9 for tutorial on Wednesday.\nExtra examples in PASIAS:\n\nanalysis of variance, chapter 13\ntidying data, chapter 17, with several examples of real-life data tidying (particularly problems 7, 8, 9 in that chapter).\n\n\n2023-10-30 12:00: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 5 is due tonight, as usual.\nthis week’s lectures: the rest of Mood’s Median test (Tuesday), and analysis of variance (Thursday, but we might start this on Tuesday). Some of the analysis of variance stuff will look familiar (from B27 or your second course), but some of it will be new to you.\nWorksheet 8 for tutorial this week, on matched pairs and Mood’s median test. Assignment 6, on those same two things, opens on Wed night.\nI keep forgetting to point you towards extra practice problems in PASIAS: matched pairs in chapter 11, Mood’s median test in chapter 10, normal quantile plots in chapter 12, and analysis of variance in chapter 13. (The chapters are slightly out of order at this point, corresponding with how I did things in the past.)\nLooking ahead: the assignments will go up to #8, due on November 20. (As things stand now, this will be on the second part of tidying data and the first part of regression.) I want to give you a bit of a break at the end of the course, but be aware that the rest of the material after that (multiple regression, functions, dates and times) will be on the final exam and so there will be worksheets 11 and 12 to enable you to practice those. (We have one lecture after the final tutorial, so the last worksheet might stretch to the content in that last lecture.)\n\n2023-10-26 14:20: re final exam: the dates and times of the final exams are now public, but the rooms are not. I am told that we will soon have access to a tool that will tell us which room to go to. To keep the campus safe, don’t tell people outside our class which room our final is in (once you find out).\n2023-10-26 13:35: further to our discussion in class today about P-values: I talked about Fisher (who we learned about in connection with 0.05) and Neyman and Pearson. I didn’t have it quite right, according to this, which is a 1993 paper from the Journal of the American Statistical Association by a veteran statistician who worked in hypothesis testing. My TL;DR of the paper, along with some of my own opinions, is this:\n\nFisher was very argumentative, especially about the rightness of his views and the wrongness of everybody else’s, and the two schools of hypothesis testing had more in common than it may have seemed at the time.\nIf you look in the back of the textbook for your first statistics course, you’ll see that there are tables of complete probabilities for the (standard) normal distribution, but only some probabilities for the t-distribution (and the chi-squared distribution). The “only some” probabilities was started by Fisher. This was apparently not because he was of the decision-making school, even though we saw the quote earlier in lecture about how he made that comment about 5%; he was more of the strength-of-evidence school and organized statistical tables while expecting you to say “the P-value is between 0.01 and 0.05” or whatever.\nFisher only considered the null hypothesis and the probability of type I error.\nJerzy Neyman (Polish) and Egon Pearson (English) were more firmly of the decision-making school (do you reject the null? Yes or no?), but they also believed that you should have your alternative hypothesis in mind, and devised tests that gave you the most power while keeping the type I error probability under control. Sometimes this gives the same test as Fisher would have used, and sometimes not.\nEgon Pearson’s father, Karl Pearson, was also a statistician, and invented the chi-squared test that we saw in lecture today.\nSome things, like Pearson Sr.’s chi-squared test and the Welch t-test, don’t really come from a theory of “this is the best test”, but rather from “here is something we can do that looks sensible”. If you have done the chi-squared test by hand, that business of observed minus expected squared, divided by expected, was Pearson’s “sensible idea”; the actual best test is slightly different but usually gives similar results. Welch was looking for a way of getting P-values for his two-sample t-test out of standard t-tables, and did it by approximating the degrees of freedom in a way that worked and had some theoretical basis (but may not be the absolute best).\nThe theory we have today is sort of a mish-mash of Fisher and Neyman-and-Pearson, and different people use it in different ways. Some people think of the P-value as a decision-making tool, and some as the strength of evidence (and some people, Bayesian statisticians mostly, think that we should be doing something entirely different).\n\n2023-10-26 13:30: my solutions to assignment 4.\n2023-10-23 23:20: a rather late Monday update before I head for bed:\n\nAssignment 4 due in about 35 minutes.\nthis week’s lectures, a bit indefinite. My recollection is that the first two of these go pretty fast, but we’ll see.\n\nTuesday: normal quantile plots and maybe some of matched pairs\nThursday: the rest of matched pairs and start Mood’s median test.\n\nWorksheet 7 for tutorial on Wed\nAssignment 5 will open on Wed and be due next week Monday as usual.\n\n2023-10-19 11:45: My solutions to Assignment 3. I am about to release the marks; appeals by the usual procedure between Oct 22 and Oct 29 inclusive.\n2023-10-16 11:45: back to work, and back to Monday updates:\n\ndon’t forget that Assignment 3 is due tonight, the one you’ve had about three weeks to work on.\nthis week’s lectures will be:\n\nTuesday: finish off power, start sign test\nThursday: finish sign test, start normal quantile plot\n\nworksheet 6 on power and sign test, for Wednesday tutorial.\nAssignment 4 on the same material as worksheet 6 will open on Wednesday night and be due on Monday 23rd at 11:59pm.\nwe had an extra Worksheet before the midterm, so the rest of the way, Worksheet \\(n\\) goes with Assignment \\(n-2\\).\n\n2023-10-11 10:45: I am about to release the midterm marks and send you your marked exam:\n\nmark (out of 57) will be on Quercus. (I think I said 67 before; it’s actually 57.)\nto see your marked exam, look in your email: you will have an email from Crowdmark with instructions to access your marked exam.\nread over your marked exam with my solutions.\nappeals: same procedure as for assignments. See note on 2023-09-21 11:00. You need to demonstrate an error in the marking of your exam, relative to my solutions. I will not overrule a grader’s judgement for part marks; thus, the only things worth appealing are (a) actual errors like addition errors (very unlikely here) or (b) when the grader appears to have missed part of your work and you should get full marks. If (b) is the case, you should make the case that your work is a complete answer: that is to say, that it says all the same things that my solutions do. Appeals window: between Oct 14 and Oct 21 inclusive.\nif your midterm mark disappoints you, it is up to you to sort out how you can study more effectively for the final. Some tips:\n\nattend every lecture and take notes. I say more in lecture than is on the slides, so you need to note things down so that you do not forget them.\nif you must miss class (eg. you are sick), it is still your responsibility to catch up on the material you miss, eg. by watching the old lecture videos. You should watch these with the current slides and note any differences (the material in the slides is what you need to learn).\ngo to every tutorial, do every worksheet, and ask questions of the TA if you get stuck. Finish the worksheet on your own time if you don’t finish in tutorial.\nfor extra practice, read and work through the appropriate chapters of PASIAS\ndo your assignments yourself using your lecture notes. They are designed to be mostly straightforward if you have done the corresponding worksheet. Getting outside assistance on the assignments may confuse you more than it helps you.\n\n\n2023-10-10 17:30: the midterms are graded. I don’t have time to share the grades or marked exams yet (later tonight or tomorrow morning), but the stats are: Q1 40/57 (71%), median 45.5/57 (80%), Q3 50/57 (88%). These are partly a reflection of some excellent work, and partly a reflection of this being a short and relatively straightforward exam. While I won’t be making the final exam extra-difficult, be aware that you may find it longer and tougher, because there is more stuff that might be on it that you’ll need to know about. (This is a more or less inevitable consequence of having an early midterm; if we had had a late midterm, you would probably have had a harder time on the midterm and an easier time on the final.)\n2023-10-10 14:00: reading week non-Monday update:\n\nthe midterm is, as I write, 96% graded (just one question to go)\nreminder: no lectures or tutorials this week\nAssignment 3 is due on Mon Oct 16 (and there will be assignments due weekly from then on)\nwhen the midterm is graded: I will post the marks on Quercus, explain the appeal process (it will be like the process for the assignments), and you will get your marked exams back via an email from Crowdmark (which will tell you what you need to do).\n\n2023-10-07 21:00: because I am a professor, I have been spending my Saturday night marking your midterms (as opposed to, say, hanging out at the pub with a beer). I am now done my share, and the marking in total is 87% done, with just question 2 left. I have been adding to my solutions with extra comments related to the questions I have been marking. Here are my solutions.\n2023-10-06 18:00: the midterm is 47% marked (though my suspicion is that it’s the easiest 47%). The long Question 3 is done, along with 1(a) and (c) and part of (b).\n2023-10-05 10:45: midterm was last night:\n\nExpect grading to happen over the next week or so. If you missed the midterm (for whatever reason), the 30% of your grade that was on it is automatically transferred to the final exam. (You don’t need to ask; it will happen automatically.)\nThis was one of the shortest midterms I have given (as well as one of the earliest; these things go together). This made the midterm easier for you, but it also makes the final harder, because there is more stuff that could be on the final that you will need to be prepared for.\nIf it so happens that you do better on the final exam than the midterm, I will count your final exam instead of the midterm. (I think that is unlikely this semester, but if it happens for you, you can take advantage of it.)\n\n2023-10-02 19:30: Assignment 2 is graded, and I am about to post the marks. Appeals by the same procedure as assignment 1, between Oct 5 and Oct 12 inclusive.\n2023-10-02 14:00 (edited 14:30):\n\nI forgot that the week of October 9-13 is reading week (no lectures or tutorials), so Assignment 3 is now due the week after that (Oct 16). Looking ahead, Assignment 4 will go with worksheets 5 and 6, so I will try not to make it too long.\nOn the schedule for this week:\n\nTuesday lecture: bootstrap sampling distribution of sample mean (which will give a better answer to a question from last week). I will have office hours afterwards from 2-4 in IC 471.\nWednesday: tutorial and midterm. If you’re in the 4-5 tutorial, make sure to allow yourself enough time to get to the exam room. Expect that the TAs in that tutorial will end it early so that you and they can get to the exam on time. Feel free to use tutorial time to ask questions about exam material, including the stuff that is on worksheet 5.\nThe midterm has 5 questions with 22 parts altogether, worth a total of 67 points.\nThursday lecture: power analysis, which will probably continue after reading week.\n\n\n2023-09-29 12:00: My solutions to assignment 2.\n2023-09-28 14:20: as promised, Assignment 3 is open but is now not due until Oct 9, so that you are not worrying about doing that at the same time as preparing for the midterm. (Having said that, working on Assignment 3 may be helpful in your preparations.) If you want more examples of the latest material, look in PASIAS: Chapter 6 for the one-sample stuff, and Chapter 7 for the two-sample material we looked at today.\n2023-09-28 13:45: midterm is confirmed: Wed Oct 4, 5:00-7:00pm in HW 216.\n2023-09-28 11:30: I am sharing the next worksheet with you early so that you can practice the stuff in today’s lecture.\n2023-09-26 12:30: what to expect for the midterm (whenever it is)\n\nopen book: you can bring any printed or handwritten material you wish (no computers)\nmake sure you organize what you bring so that you can find what you need during the exam\nexam will include writing code (by hand, sorry) and interpreting output\nyou will receive an exam paper with spaces to write your answers (that you hand in)\nyou will also receive a booklet of numbered figures to refer to while writing the exam\nthe exam style will be similar to old midterms and, indeed, to the assignments you have seen so far\nif there is an assignment due close to the midterm date, I will reschedule the assignment.\n\n2023-09-25 18:00: a rather late Monday update:\n\nbreaking news: it is possible that our midterm may be as early as October 4. I will let you know as soon as possible when we have a confirmed date, time, and place, and if it is then or later.\nAssignment 2 is due tonight at 11:59pm.\nin lectures this week:\n\nTuesday: finish off one-sample inference\nThursday: two-sample inference.\n\nthis week’s tutorial features worksheet 4. The second question there is on one-sample inference.\nnow that I have you thinking about the midterm:\n\nthe course website has a selection of past midterms (under Old Exams). Some years, the midterm is later or earlier than others, and so there will be more or less material included in the midterm (and you will see some things in old midterms (perhaps many things) that we haven’t covered yet).\nthe coverage for our midterm, whenever it is, will be up to the end of the last lecture but one before the midterm. (Examples: if the midterm is on a Wednesday, that means up to the previous Thursday, and if it is on a Friday, that means up to the previous Tuesday.)\nif you want more examples of anything, look at PASIAS. These are old homework problems, with answers, for example:\n\nchapter 2 on reading in data\nchapter 3 on drawing graphs\nchapter 4 on numerical summaries\nchapter 5 on choosing rows and columns\nchapter 6 on one-sample inference\nchapter 7 on two-sample inference\n\nAssignment 3 is currently scheduled to be due on October 2. That will be rescheduled if it turns out to be close to the midterm.\n\n\n2023-09-21 11:00: Assignment 1 has been graded, and I am about to post the marks. My solutions. Read through your work with my solutions and the grader’s comments to learn what you can do better next time. If you wish to appeal your assignment mark, read all of the following:\n\nwait before appealing anything.\nwrite me an email with the word “appeal” and the assignment number in the subject line, between September 25 and October 2 inclusive, in which you explain how there was an error in the grading of your assignment: that is to say, the grader missed something you wrote that was completely correct according to my solutions or that you argue also was a complete answer to the question. This also includes such things as addition errors in your assignment mark.\nthe grader’s judgement (on part marks for a question part, for example) is not open to appeal. The reason for this is that the grader makes a number of judgement calls when grading an assignment. Sometimes their call is more rigorous than you would like, and sometimes it is generous. These will even out over the course of the semester. The purpose of grade appeals is to correct errors, where you can make a convincing case that you deserve full marks on part of a question.\nfor more detail, see detailed course policies, items 3.18 through 3.22.\n\n2023-09-19 11:45: Worksheet 3 for tutorial tomorrow (added now because I am likely to forget otherwise).\n2023-09-18 09:00: Here’s the plan for this week:\n\nMonday at 11:59pm: Assignment 1 is due. It remains open until Wed at the same time, but there is a late penalty (1% per hour).\nTuesday lecture: finish numerical summaries, choosing things from dataframes\nWednesday tutorial: worksheet on numerical summaries and choosing things from dataframes. Assignment 2 on the same things opens, and is due next Monday.\nThursday lecture: finish choosing things from dataframes, start one-sample t-tests.\nAt the end of the week, we will be beginning a longish collection of work on statistical inference, many of the ideas in which you have seen before. I have two goals with that work:\n\nto show you how it works with R\nto make sure that you know what you are doing (especially when it comes to setting up and interpreting hypothesis tests), because typically people don’t seem to learn that very well the first time around. I also try to provide some context for how the various inferential methods fit together and where you would use each (and some graphs you can use to help you decide).\n\n\n2023-09-15 13:50: if you were (until yesterday) on the waitlist for this course, you need to know that the course is full and the only way you will be able to get into the course now is if someone drops the course and you are quick enough to grab their spot. If you need this course to graduate, it was your responsibility to register for it as soon as possible after your registration opened. See the notes on July 24. It is not possible for you to be added to the course; if you ask me, the answer is no.\n2023-09-14 15:10: that lost phone is now with Lost and Found (SW 304). If it is yours, claim it from there.\n2023-09-14 09:45: for assignment 1, if you are running R on your own computer and that computer is running Windows, then the code I gave you with download.file in it should look like this:\n\ndownload.file(my_url, \"walking.xls\", mode = \"wb\")\nwhere my_url is the URL I gave you (that ends in .xls). If you are using r.datatools, or if your computer is a Mac (or runs Linux), then you should be OK with the code I gave you in the assignment. (The assignment question file is now updated.) Thanks to the student who spotted this quicker than I did!\n\n2023-09-12 23:55: just remembered that I need to post worksheet 2 for tutorial.\n2023-09-12 15:00: Somebody dropped their phone on the way out of lecture today. I have the phone. Come collect it from me in my office (IC 471). I’m here for another 30 mins or so today and likely sometime tomorrow.\n2023-09-12 10:45: It was raining heavily when I arrived on campus, but I am here (if rather wet). As I write, Accuweather says that there will be another shower finishing around 11:30, then another around 14:00 when our class finishes.\n2023-09-11 12:15: On the agenda for this week:\n\nMaking graphs (Tuesday)\nNumerical summaries (Thursday)\nThe start of “Choosing things in dataframes” (maybe Thursday)\nThere will be a Worksheet 2 for tutorial on Wednesday, on reading data from files and making graphs.\nAssignment 1, on those same two things, will open on Wednesday night and be due the following Monday at 11:59pm.\nYou can expect, at least until we get to the midterm, that Assignment \\(n\\) will be on the same material as Worksheet \\(n+1\\), and both of those will be based on the material in the Thursday and Tuesday lectures before you tackle Worksheet \\(n+1\\).\n\n2023-09-11 11:30 edit 2023-09-12 12:00: I have just taken a look through the Assignment 0 that you handed in:\n\nIf you got 1 (out of 1), I could see your data and your graph, and it looked like the right thing.\nIf you got 0 and you handed something in, there was something I couldn’t read, and you will have an Assignment Comment telling you what happened and what you need to do to fix it. Feel free to try again; you have unlimited submissions on this “Assignment”, and it’s still open.\nIt doesn’t count towards your course grade (ignore any late penalty), therefore the point of Assignment 0 is to get it right, so that you will also get the handing in of the other assignments right.\nEdit to add: I have looked through the ones that were handed since I looked yesterday, and most people have got it right now (I added a comment one way or the other). In my experience, the people that have trouble handing in assignments (real ones) later are people who didn’t hand in Assignment 0. This is a free chance to get the procedure right before it counts for anything.\n\n2023-09-07 11:20: some files for today’s lecture:\n\nthe first spreadsheet\nthe CSV version of that\nthe coffee cup data\nthe second spreadsheet\nthe migraine data\n\n2023-09-06 11:00: this is our first time using Quarto documents in this course, and there are (inevitably) some teething troubles. Some of you in the 9am tutorial discovered that your graphs were disappearing after you rendered a document and downloaded it to hand in. The solution is this: up at the very top of your document, you’ll see a line like this:\n\nformat: html\nRemove that line and replace it with these lines:\nformat:\n  html:\n    embed-resources: true\n    df-print: paged\n(the indentation on the lines after the first is important: it should be two spaces on the html line and four spaces on the lines below that).\nThese lines should be at the top of any document where you plan to take the html output and move it somewhere else (eg. hand it in on Quercus, or download it and look at it).\nIf you are wondering why that is: things like graphs on your output are actually stored as image files, in the same folder as your Quarto document is (which might be on r.datatools). When you look at the html file there, the images are in the same folder and show up, but when you move the html file somewhere else, the images don’t go with it and are thus not available when you look at the html on your machine or on Quercus. (The same applies if you are running R on your computer: as soon as you hand the html file in on Quercus, because you have moved the file from one place to another, the images are gone.) The fix above makes the html file “self-contained”, in that it contains everything it needs to display properly, wherever you move it to. The bottom line, the df-print one, is actually nothing to do with this; all it does is to make dataframes display nicely in your output, but since it fits here and is nice to know about, I’m suggesting that you add it too.\nThis is actually exactly the same problem as I had with the original version of worksheet 1 that some of you downloaded yesterday and saw was missing images (my screenshots). I applied the same fix as above to my file, not realizing (yesterday) that you were going to run into the same thing today. You are welcome to have another go at editing your “Assignment 0” Quarto document as above, re-rendering it and handing it in again. This time you should find that the graphs and any other images did indeed make it to the thing you handed in. (You can hand in Assignment 0 as many times as you like.)\n\n2023-09-05 14:25 edited 15:15: I messed up some connections to things:\n\nworksheet 1 (now fixed)\nthe lecture slides page, which seems to be linking to last year’s (now fixed)\nthe lecture videos page, which you don’t have permission to access yet, so I need to move it somewhere where you do (I think I have done now.) I think I have fixed everything now. Let me know of any lingering problems (if needed, reload any such pages and see if that fixes things).\n\n2023-09-05 11:40: Here is Worksheet 1 that you’ll be working through in tutorial tomorrow.\n2023-09-01 20:30: We get underway on Tuesday next week, September 5. The agenda for the week is:\n\nTuesday: brief look at the syllabus, introduction to R and R Studio\nWednesday: tutorial (yes, we have tutorials in week 1) where you will be working through a worksheet with a TA there for help if you get stuck. I do this so you can hit the ground running, and practice what we have seen in lecture as soon as possible.\nThursday: reading data from files, and making graphs (or, some of the latter, anyway). Expect to see a worksheet on this week’s material in the week 2 tutorial, and an Assignment 1 on that same material coming out after your week 2 tutorial.\n\n2023-07-24 16:15: I have added a few students from the waitlist. These are the fourth years who joined the waitlist before July 19, and the third years who joined the waitlist before 08:15:30 on July 11. There is not likely to be room to add further students, and so if you if you are still on the waitlist after that, you will have to take your chances. There is a large demand for this course, so it is important to register for it as soon as your registration window opens.\n2023-07-24 15:45: there were seven people enrolled in the course or on the waitlist without a prerequisite course (STAB27 or equivalent). These students have been removed from the course.\n2023-07-24 15:00: time to open up the website for this year, now that the course is open for enrolment:\n\nI’m aware that there is already a waitlist. I plan to look more carefully at who is on the waitlist, with the aim of making sure that those who really need the course are able to take it. My priority order is: students in the Statistics Applied Minor program, and within those, students in the fourth year of study (or beyond) as calculated by UTSC, then students in earlier years of study in the program, and then students in other programs. Appealing directly to me is a waste of your time.\nI will be checking prerequisites. To take STAC32, you must have completed (by the time STAC32 starts in September) either STAB27 or PSYC08 or MGEB12. If you have not completed one of these courses by then, you will be removed from STAC32.\nLooking ahead to next winter’s STAD29: my aim is to make sure that there will be enough space in that course for everyone that wants to take it (and has completed STAC32).\nProgram FAQ."

    "text": "2023-12-08 16:45:\n\nThe final exam has gone for printing. I decided to keep all the questions I had, and I think it actually adds up to exactly 100 points (I didn’t add anything).\nThe final exam is more than 50% longer than the (very short) midterm, so if you were running short of time on the midterm, be aware that you will need to be more organized for the final. (On the midterm, as far as I could tell, most people seemed to have plenty of time.)\nAs a guide, you have about 4 minutes per part and a bit less than 2 minutes per point. (Some of the parts and points will be a lot quicker than that if you are well prepared.)\nI have been tinkering with the website, to make my organization of it better. You will notice that it looks a little different. I think everything is where it should be, but if you notice anything missing, let me know.\nI will have office hours on Wednesday next week. I’m aiming to be around 11:00am to 1:00pm, so that you can still catch me if you have either a morning or an afternoon exam that day.\n\n2023-11-27 16:55: I think I am happy with the general shape of the final exam. It now has 7 questions with a total of 41 parts worth a total of 99 points. I still need to do some serious editing; I am not going to make it any longer, but it might end up being a little shorter than it is now.\n2023-11-27 11:30: into the last week of classes:\n\nI just posted an announcement on Quercus with the date, time, and location of our final exam. This is on Quercus only for security reasons (to be only accessible to people in this course).\nAssignment 7 is mostly graded and Assignment 8 is partly graded. I will release the grades when I have confirmation that the grading is done. My solutions to Assignment 8.\nWorksheet 12 for this week’s tutorial. This is rather long, to give you lots of opportunity for practice.\nLectures this week (yes, we are not done yet):\n\nTuesday: finish the multiple regression material, including regression with categorical variables.\nThursday: functions, as far as we get through that.\n\nPASIAS problems on functions.\n\n2023-11-22 21:15: There is a Worksheet 12 ready for next week, which I will share on Monday. I have also been working on our final exam, which currently has 5 questions with a total of 28 parts worth a total of 67 points. I plan to add two more questions, so that the total points is somewhere near 90. Be aware that this will be more than 50% longer than the midterm — you will need to make sure to have your materials organized so that you can work efficiently.\n2023-11-20 14:15: this is week 11 (of 12, the last lecture being on Nov 30).\n\nAssignment 7 is being graded. My solutions. Assignment 8 is due tonight, and will be the final one. (The best 6 out of your assignment scores, by percentage, will count towards your course grade.)\nLectures this week:\n\nTuesday: finish the windmill case study and start on the asphalt one (multiple regression)\nThursday: finish the asphalt case study and start on regression with categorical variables.\nThe rest of the way: I want to finish the regression stuff and talk about functions. I have some stuff about dates and times that I will probably leave until D29.\n\nWorksheet 11 on simple and multiple regression, for tutorial on Wednesday. This is rather long, and includes more material on multiple regression than we will likely get to in the Tuesday lecture, but it seemed to fit together well, and it gives you a chance to practice everything. You may prefer to leave some of it until after Thursday’s lecture.\nPASIAS problems for multiple regression, to practice after we get to that.\n\n2023-11-13 15:15: A slightly late Monday update, because I realized I got out of sync with where I expected to be, and the worksheet 10 and assignment 8 I had planned were no longer suitable. Anyway, that is now fixed, and the story is this:\n\nAssignment 6 has been graded. My solutions. Appeals by usual procedure between Nov 16 and Nov 23.\nAssignment 7 is due tonight; the final Assignment 8 opens on Wed night.\nlectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of tidying data\nThursday: simple regression (one \\(x\\)-variable; the windmill case study)\n\nWorksheet 10 for tutorial on Wed. This is rather long, but I wanted to give you some practice on various aspects of tidying data. (Assignment 8 is actually rather short.)\nPASIAS problems on simple regression, for later in the week.\n\n2023-11-11 20:00: How to get good with R, a blog post by Nick Tierney (who is good with R).\n2023-11-07 12:30: Assignment 4 is also graded. My solutions. Appeals by usual procedure between Nov 10 and Nov 17 inclusive.\n2023-11-06 13:55: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 5 is graded. My solutions. Appeals by usual procedure between Nov 9 and Nov 16 inclusive.\nthe longer Assignment 4 is about 2/3 graded. I will post the grades for that when it is finished.\nAssignment 6 due tonight; Assignment 7 opens on Wed night.\nin lecture this week: tidying data. There are about three pieces of lecture notes on this: tidying data, extras, when pivot-wider goes wrong. I intend to finish the first of those tomorrow.\nyou may have noticed that there is a lecture on writing reports. I am skipping that this time.\nWorksheet 9 for tutorial on Wednesday.\nExtra examples in PASIAS:\n\nanalysis of variance, chapter 13\ntidying data, chapter 17, with several examples of real-life data tidying (particularly problems 7, 8, 9 in that chapter).\n\n\n2023-10-30 12:00: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 5 is due tonight, as usual.\nthis week’s lectures: the rest of Mood’s Median test (Tuesday), and analysis of variance (Thursday, but we might start this on Tuesday). Some of the analysis of variance stuff will look familiar (from B27 or your second course), but some of it will be new to you.\nWorksheet 8 for tutorial this week, on matched pairs and Mood’s median test. Assignment 6, on those same two things, opens on Wed night.\nI keep forgetting to point you towards extra practice problems in PASIAS: matched pairs in chapter 11, Mood’s median test in chapter 10, normal quantile plots in chapter 12, and analysis of variance in chapter 13. (The chapters are slightly out of order at this point, corresponding with how I did things in the past.)\nLooking ahead: the assignments will go up to #8, due on November 20. (As things stand now, this will be on the second part of tidying data and the first part of regression.) I want to give you a bit of a break at the end of the course, but be aware that the rest of the material after that (multiple regression, functions, dates and times) will be on the final exam and so there will be worksheets 11 and 12 to enable you to practice those. (We have one lecture after the final tutorial, so the last worksheet might stretch to the content in that last lecture.)\n\n2023-10-26 14:20: re final exam: the dates and times of the final exams are now public, but the rooms are not. I am told that we will soon have access to a tool that will tell us which room to go to. To keep the campus safe, don’t tell people outside our class which room our final is in (once you find out).\n2023-10-26 13:35: further to our discussion in class today about P-values: I talked about Fisher (who we learned about in connection with 0.05) and Neyman and Pearson. I didn’t have it quite right, according to this, which is a 1993 paper from the Journal of the American Statistical Association by a veteran statistician who worked in hypothesis testing. My TL;DR of the paper, along with some of my own opinions, is this:\n\nFisher was very argumentative, especially about the rightness of his views and the wrongness of everybody else’s, and the two schools of hypothesis testing had more in common than it may have seemed at the time.\nIf you look in the back of the textbook for your first statistics course, you’ll see that there are tables of complete probabilities for the (standard) normal distribution, but only some probabilities for the t-distribution (and the chi-squared distribution). The “only some” probabilities was started by Fisher. This was apparently not because he was of the decision-making school, even though we saw the quote earlier in lecture about how he made that comment about 5%; he was more of the strength-of-evidence school and organized statistical tables while expecting you to say “the P-value is between 0.01 and 0.05” or whatever.\nFisher only considered the null hypothesis and the probability of type I error.\nJerzy Neyman (Polish) and Egon Pearson (English) were more firmly of the decision-making school (do you reject the null? Yes or no?), but they also believed that you should have your alternative hypothesis in mind, and devised tests that gave you the most power while keeping the type I error probability under control. Sometimes this gives the same test as Fisher would have used, and sometimes not.\nEgon Pearson’s father, Karl Pearson, was also a statistician, and invented the chi-squared test that we saw in lecture today.\nSome things, like Pearson Sr.’s chi-squared test and the Welch t-test, don’t really come from a theory of “this is the best test”, but rather from “here is something we can do that looks sensible”. If you have done the chi-squared test by hand, that business of observed minus expected squared, divided by expected, was Pearson’s “sensible idea”; the actual best test is slightly different but usually gives similar results. Welch was looking for a way of getting P-values for his two-sample t-test out of standard t-tables, and did it by approximating the degrees of freedom in a way that worked and had some theoretical basis (but may not be the absolute best).\nThe theory we have today is sort of a mish-mash of Fisher and Neyman-and-Pearson, and different people use it in different ways. Some people think of the P-value as a decision-making tool, and some as the strength of evidence (and some people, Bayesian statisticians mostly, think that we should be doing something entirely different).\n\n2023-10-26 13:30: my solutions to assignment 4.\n2023-10-23 23:20: a rather late Monday update before I head for bed:\n\nAssignment 4 due in about 35 minutes.\nthis week’s lectures, a bit indefinite. My recollection is that the first two of these go pretty fast, but we’ll see.\n\nTuesday: normal quantile plots and maybe some of matched pairs\nThursday: the rest of matched pairs and start Mood’s median test.\n\nWorksheet 7 for tutorial on Wed\nAssignment 5 will open on Wed and be due next week Monday as usual.\n\n2023-10-19 11:45: My solutions to Assignment 3. I am about to release the marks; appeals by the usual procedure between Oct 22 and Oct 29 inclusive.\n2023-10-16 11:45: back to work, and back to Monday updates:\n\ndon’t forget that Assignment 3 is due tonight, the one you’ve had about three weeks to work on.\nthis week’s lectures will be:\n\nTuesday: finish off power, start sign test\nThursday: finish sign test, start normal quantile plot\n\nworksheet 6 on power and sign test, for Wednesday tutorial.\nAssignment 4 on the same material as worksheet 6 will open on Wednesday night and be due on Monday 23rd at 11:59pm.\nwe had an extra Worksheet before the midterm, so the rest of the way, Worksheet \\(n\\) goes with Assignment \\(n-2\\).\n\n2023-10-11 10:45: I am about to release the midterm marks and send you your marked exam:\n\nmark (out of 57) will be on Quercus. (I think I said 67 before; it’s actually 57.)\nto see your marked exam, look in your email: you will have an email from Crowdmark with instructions to access your marked exam.\nread over your marked exam with my solutions.\nappeals: same procedure as for assignments. See note on 2023-09-21 11:00. You need to demonstrate an error in the marking of your exam, relative to my solutions. I will not overrule a grader’s judgement for part marks; thus, the only things worth appealing are (a) actual errors like addition errors (very unlikely here) or (b) when the grader appears to have missed part of your work and you should get full marks. If (b) is the case, you should make the case that your work is a complete answer: that is to say, that it says all the same things that my solutions do. Appeals window: between Oct 14 and Oct 21 inclusive.\nif your midterm mark disappoints you, it is up to you to sort out how you can study more effectively for the final. Some tips:\n\nattend every lecture and take notes. I say more in lecture than is on the slides, so you need to note things down so that you do not forget them.\nif you must miss class (eg. you are sick), it is still your responsibility to catch up on the material you miss, eg. by watching the old lecture videos. You should watch these with the current slides and note any differences (the material in the slides is what you need to learn).\ngo to every tutorial, do every worksheet, and ask questions of the TA if you get stuck. Finish the worksheet on your own time if you don’t finish in tutorial.\nfor extra practice, read and work through the appropriate chapters of PASIAS\ndo your assignments yourself using your lecture notes. They are designed to be mostly straightforward if you have done the corresponding worksheet. Getting outside assistance on the assignments may confuse you more than it helps you.\n\n\n2023-10-10 17:30: the midterms are graded. I don’t have time to share the grades or marked exams yet (later tonight or tomorrow morning), but the stats are: Q1 40/57 (71%), median 45.5/57 (80%), Q3 50/57 (88%). These are partly a reflection of some excellent work, and partly a reflection of this being a short and relatively straightforward exam. While I won’t be making the final exam extra-difficult, be aware that you may find it longer and tougher, because there is more stuff that might be on it that you’ll need to know about. (This is a more or less inevitable consequence of having an early midterm; if we had had a late midterm, you would probably have had a harder time on the midterm and an easier time on the final.)\n2023-10-10 14:00: reading week non-Monday update:\n\nthe midterm is, as I write, 96% graded (just one question to go)\nreminder: no lectures or tutorials this week\nAssignment 3 is due on Mon Oct 16 (and there will be assignments due weekly from then on)\nwhen the midterm is graded: I will post the marks on Quercus, explain the appeal process (it will be like the process for the assignments), and you will get your marked exams back via an email from Crowdmark (which will tell you what you need to do).\n\n2023-10-07 21:00: because I am a professor, I have been spending my Saturday night marking your midterms (as opposed to, say, hanging out at the pub with a beer). I am now done my share, and the marking in total is 87% done, with just question 2 left. I have been adding to my solutions with extra comments related to the questions I have been marking. Here are my solutions.\n2023-10-06 18:00: the midterm is 47% marked (though my suspicion is that it’s the easiest 47%). The long Question 3 is done, along with 1(a) and (c) and part of (b).\n2023-10-05 10:45: midterm was last night:\n\nExpect grading to happen over the next week or so. If you missed the midterm (for whatever reason), the 30% of your grade that was on it is automatically transferred to the final exam. (You don’t need to ask; it will happen automatically.)\nThis was one of the shortest midterms I have given (as well as one of the earliest; these things go together). This made the midterm easier for you, but it also makes the final harder, because there is more stuff that could be on the final that you will need to be prepared for.\nIf it so happens that you do better on the final exam than the midterm, I will count your final exam instead of the midterm. (I think that is unlikely this semester, but if it happens for you, you can take advantage of it.)\n\n2023-10-02 19:30: Assignment 2 is graded, and I am about to post the marks. Appeals by the same procedure as assignment 1, between Oct 5 and Oct 12 inclusive.\n2023-10-02 14:00 (edited 14:30):\n\nI forgot that the week of October 9-13 is reading week (no lectures or tutorials), so Assignment 3 is now due the week after that (Oct 16). Looking ahead, Assignment 4 will go with worksheets 5 and 6, so I will try not to make it too long.\nOn the schedule for this week:\n\nTuesday lecture: bootstrap sampling distribution of sample mean (which will give a better answer to a question from last week). I will have office hours afterwards from 2-4 in IC 471.\nWednesday: tutorial and midterm. If you’re in the 4-5 tutorial, make sure to allow yourself enough time to get to the exam room. Expect that the TAs in that tutorial will end it early so that you and they can get to the exam on time. Feel free to use tutorial time to ask questions about exam material, including the stuff that is on worksheet 5.\nThe midterm has 5 questions with 22 parts altogether, worth a total of 67 points.\nThursday lecture: power analysis, which will probably continue after reading week.\n\n\n2023-09-29 12:00: My solutions to assignment 2.\n2023-09-28 14:20: as promised, Assignment 3 is open but is now not due until Oct 9, so that you are not worrying about doing that at the same time as preparing for the midterm. (Having said that, working on Assignment 3 may be helpful in your preparations.) If you want more examples of the latest material, look in PASIAS: Chapter 6 for the one-sample stuff, and Chapter 7 for the two-sample material we looked at today.\n2023-09-28 13:45: midterm is confirmed: Wed Oct 4, 5:00-7:00pm in HW 216.\n2023-09-28 11:30: I am sharing the next worksheet with you early so that you can practice the stuff in today’s lecture.\n2023-09-26 12:30: what to expect for the midterm (whenever it is)\n\nopen book: you can bring any printed or handwritten material you wish (no computers)\nmake sure you organize what you bring so that you can find what you need during the exam\nexam will include writing code (by hand, sorry) and interpreting output\nyou will receive an exam paper with spaces to write your answers (that you hand in)\nyou will also receive a booklet of numbered figures to refer to while writing the exam\nthe exam style will be similar to old midterms and, indeed, to the assignments you have seen so far\nif there is an assignment due close to the midterm date, I will reschedule the assignment.\n\n2023-09-25 18:00: a rather late Monday update:\n\nbreaking news: it is possible that our midterm may be as early as October 4. I will let you know as soon as possible when we have a confirmed date, time, and place, and if it is then or later.\nAssignment 2 is due tonight at 11:59pm.\nin lectures this week:\n\nTuesday: finish off one-sample inference\nThursday: two-sample inference.\n\nthis week’s tutorial features worksheet 4. The second question there is on one-sample inference.\nnow that I have you thinking about the midterm:\n\nthe course website has a selection of past midterms (under Old Exams). Some years, the midterm is later or earlier than others, and so there will be more or less material included in the midterm (and you will see some things in old midterms (perhaps many things) that we haven’t covered yet).\nthe coverage for our midterm, whenever it is, will be up to the end of the last lecture but one before the midterm. (Examples: if the midterm is on a Wednesday, that means up to the previous Thursday, and if it is on a Friday, that means up to the previous Tuesday.)\nif you want more examples of anything, look at PASIAS. These are old homework problems, with answers, for example:\n\nchapter 2 on reading in data\nchapter 3 on drawing graphs\nchapter 4 on numerical summaries\nchapter 5 on choosing rows and columns\nchapter 6 on one-sample inference\nchapter 7 on two-sample inference\n\nAssignment 3 is currently scheduled to be due on October 2. That will be rescheduled if it turns out to be close to the midterm.\n\n\n2023-09-21 11:00: Assignment 1 has been graded, and I am about to post the marks. My solutions. Read through your work with my solutions and the grader’s comments to learn what you can do better next time. If you wish to appeal your assignment mark, read all of the following:\n\nwait before appealing anything.\nwrite me an email with the word “appeal” and the assignment number in the subject line, between September 25 and October 2 inclusive, in which you explain how there was an error in the grading of your assignment: that is to say, the grader missed something you wrote that was completely correct according to my solutions or that you argue also was a complete answer to the question. This also includes such things as addition errors in your assignment mark.\nthe grader’s judgement (on part marks for a question part, for example) is not open to appeal. The reason for this is that the grader makes a number of judgement calls when grading an assignment. Sometimes their call is more rigorous than you would like, and sometimes it is generous. These will even out over the course of the semester. The purpose of grade appeals is to correct errors, where you can make a convincing case that you deserve full marks on part of a question.\nfor more detail, see detailed course policies, items 3.18 through 3.22.\n\n2023-09-19 11:45: Worksheet 3 for tutorial tomorrow (added now because I am likely to forget otherwise).\n2023-09-18 09:00: Here’s the plan for this week:\n\nMonday at 11:59pm: Assignment 1 is due. It remains open until Wed at the same time, but there is a late penalty (1% per hour).\nTuesday lecture: finish numerical summaries, choosing things from dataframes\nWednesday tutorial: worksheet on numerical summaries and choosing things from dataframes. Assignment 2 on the same things opens, and is due next Monday.\nThursday lecture: finish choosing things from dataframes, start one-sample t-tests.\nAt the end of the week, we will be beginning a longish collection of work on statistical inference, many of the ideas in which you have seen before. I have two goals with that work:\n\nto show you how it works with R\nto make sure that you know what you are doing (especially when it comes to setting up and interpreting hypothesis tests), because typically people don’t seem to learn that very well the first time around. I also try to provide some context for how the various inferential methods fit together and where you would use each (and some graphs you can use to help you decide).\n\n\n2023-09-15 13:50: if you were (until yesterday) on the waitlist for this course, you need to know that the course is full and the only way you will be able to get into the course now is if someone drops the course and you are quick enough to grab their spot. If you need this course to graduate, it was your responsibility to register for it as soon as possible after your registration opened. See the notes on July 24. It is not possible for you to be added to the course; if you ask me, the answer is no.\n2023-09-14 15:10: that lost phone is now with Lost and Found (SW 304). If it is yours, claim it from there.\n2023-09-14 09:45: for assignment 1, if you are running R on your own computer and that computer is running Windows, then the code I gave you with download.file in it should look like this:\n\ndownload.file(my_url, \"walking.xls\", mode = \"wb\")\nwhere my_url is the URL I gave you (that ends in .xls). If you are using r.datatools, or if your computer is a Mac (or runs Linux), then you should be OK with the code I gave you in the assignment. (The assignment question file is now updated.) Thanks to the student who spotted this quicker than I did!\n\n2023-09-12 23:55: just remembered that I need to post worksheet 2 for tutorial.\n2023-09-12 15:00: Somebody dropped their phone on the way out of lecture today. I have the phone. Come collect it from me in my office (IC 471). I’m here for another 30 mins or so today and likely sometime tomorrow.\n2023-09-12 10:45: It was raining heavily when I arrived on campus, but I am here (if rather wet). As I write, Accuweather says that there will be another shower finishing around 11:30, then another around 14:00 when our class finishes.\n2023-09-11 12:15: On the agenda for this week:\n\nMaking graphs (Tuesday)\nNumerical summaries (Thursday)\nThe start of “Choosing things in dataframes” (maybe Thursday)\nThere will be a Worksheet 2 for tutorial on Wednesday, on reading data from files and making graphs.\nAssignment 1, on those same two things, will open on Wednesday night and be due the following Monday at 11:59pm.\nYou can expect, at least until we get to the midterm, that Assignment \\(n\\) will be on the same material as Worksheet \\(n+1\\), and both of those will be based on the material in the Thursday and Tuesday lectures before you tackle Worksheet \\(n+1\\).\n\n2023-09-11 11:30 edit 2023-09-12 12:00: I have just taken a look through the Assignment 0 that you handed in:\n\nIf you got 1 (out of 1), I could see your data and your graph, and it looked like the right thing.\nIf you got 0 and you handed something in, there was something I couldn’t read, and you will have an Assignment Comment telling you what happened and what you need to do to fix it. Feel free to try again; you have unlimited submissions on this “Assignment”, and it’s still open.\nIt doesn’t count towards your course grade (ignore any late penalty), therefore the point of Assignment 0 is to get it right, so that you will also get the handing in of the other assignments right.\nEdit to add: I have looked through the ones that were handed since I looked yesterday, and most people have got it right now (I added a comment one way or the other). In my experience, the people that have trouble handing in assignments (real ones) later are people who didn’t hand in Assignment 0. This is a free chance to get the procedure right before it counts for anything.\n\n2023-09-07 11:20: some files for today’s lecture:\n\nthe first spreadsheet\nthe CSV version of that\nthe coffee cup data\nthe second spreadsheet\nthe migraine data\n\n2023-09-06 11:00: this is our first time using Quarto documents in this course, and there are (inevitably) some teething troubles. Some of you in the 9am tutorial discovered that your graphs were disappearing after you rendered a document and downloaded it to hand in. The solution is this: up at the very top of your document, you’ll see a line like this:\n\nformat: html\nRemove that line and replace it with these lines:\nformat:\n  html:\n    embed-resources: true\n    df-print: paged\n(the indentation on the lines after the first is important: it should be two spaces on the html line and four spaces on the lines below that).\nThese lines should be at the top of any document where you plan to take the html output and move it somewhere else (eg. hand it in on Quercus, or download it and look at it).\nIf you are wondering why that is: things like graphs on your output are actually stored as image files, in the same folder as your Quarto document is (which might be on r.datatools). When you look at the html file there, the images are in the same folder and show up, but when you move the html file somewhere else, the images don’t go with it and are thus not available when you look at the html on your machine or on Quercus. (The same applies if you are running R on your computer: as soon as you hand the html file in on Quercus, because you have moved the file from one place to another, the images are gone.) The fix above makes the html file “self-contained”, in that it contains everything it needs to display properly, wherever you move it to. The bottom line, the df-print one, is actually nothing to do with this; all it does is to make dataframes display nicely in your output, but since it fits here and is nice to know about, I’m suggesting that you add it too.\nThis is actually exactly the same problem as I had with the original version of worksheet 1 that some of you downloaded yesterday and saw was missing images (my screenshots). I applied the same fix as above to my file, not realizing (yesterday) that you were going to run into the same thing today. You are welcome to have another go at editing your “Assignment 0” Quarto document as above, re-rendering it and handing it in again. This time you should find that the graphs and any other images did indeed make it to the thing you handed in. (You can hand in Assignment 0 as many times as you like.)\n\n2023-09-05 14:25 edited 15:15: I messed up some connections to things:\n\nworksheet 1 (now fixed)\nthe lecture slides page, which seems to be linking to last year’s (now fixed)\nthe lecture videos page, which you don’t have permission to access yet, so I need to move it somewhere where you do (I think I have done now.) I think I have fixed everything now. Let me know of any lingering problems (if needed, reload any such pages and see if that fixes things).\n\n2023-09-05 11:40: Here is Worksheet 1 that you’ll be working through in tutorial tomorrow.\n2023-09-01 20:30: We get underway on Tuesday next week, September 5. The agenda for the week is:\n\nTuesday: brief look at the syllabus, introduction to R and R Studio\nWednesday: tutorial (yes, we have tutorials in week 1) where you will be working through a worksheet with a TA there for help if you get stuck. I do this so you can hit the ground running, and practice what we have seen in lecture as soon as possible.\nThursday: reading data from files, and making graphs (or, some of the latter, anyway). Expect to see a worksheet on this week’s material in the week 2 tutorial, and an Assignment 1 on that same material coming out after your week 2 tutorial.\n\n2023-07-24 16:15: I have added a few students from the waitlist. These are the fourth years who joined the waitlist before July 19, and the third years who joined the waitlist before 08:15:30 on July 11. There is not likely to be room to add further students, and so if you if you are still on the waitlist after that, you will have to take your chances. There is a large demand for this course, so it is important to register for it as soon as your registration window opens.\n2023-07-24 15:45: there were seven people enrolled in the course or on the waitlist without a prerequisite course (STAB27 or equivalent). These students have been removed from the course.\n2023-07-24 15:00: time to open up the website for this year, now that the course is open for enrolment:\n\nI’m aware that there is already a waitlist. I plan to look more carefully at who is on the waitlist, with the aim of making sure that those who really need the course are able to take it. My priority order is: students in the Statistics Applied Minor program, and within those, students in the fourth year of study (or beyond) as calculated by UTSC, then students in earlier years of study in the program, and then students in other programs. Appealing directly to me is a waste of your time.\nI will be checking prerequisites. To take STAC32, you must have completed (by the time STAC32 starts in September) either STAB27 or PSYC08 or MGEB12. If you have not completed one of these courses by then, you will be removed from STAC32.\nLooking ahead to next winter’s STAD29: my aim is to make sure that there will be enough space in that course for everyone that wants to take it (and has completed STAC32).\nProgram FAQ."
