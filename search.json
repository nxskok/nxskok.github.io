    "text": "bad picture\n\n\nWelcome to the home page for STA 1007 / STAD29. This is the place to look for things course-related (notes, code, old exams etc., linked above) except for lecture videos, assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on Quercus.\n\n\n\n\n2024-04-25 15:00: all done, and grades submitted. They will reach you about two business days after being approved.\n2024-04-25 22:45: 90% done. A little of questions 1 and 2 are all that remain. All being well, grades tomorrow.\n2024-04-24 23:15: 78% done. What’s left is a bit of question 1, all of question 2, and a bit of question 3.\n2024-04-23 23:00: We have all the exams now (there had been a problem with uploading the other exams, but we now have them all). This means that the percent done has actually slipped back to 51% (out of a now larger number of questions to grade), but I’ve had a good day: I am caught up with questions 5 and 6 on all the exams, plus the parts of question 7 I marked yesterday. What remains for me is the last few parts of question 4 for the exams I got today, and the last few parts of question 7 for all the exams. I have worked hard at being consistent between the exams I had and the ones I got today. The course graders are marking questions 1 through 3; expect the marking to be done by about Friday, which would mean grades reaching you on Monday.\n2024-04-22 23:10: I’m now up to 7(c) on the exams I have; what remains is the rest of question 7, the other exams that are coming, and questions 1 to 3 that are being graded by the TAs. We are currently at 53%.\n2024-04-21 23:00: As I said yesterday, I don’t have all the exams scanned yet, but out of the ones I do have, we are now 25% done, and I’m done questions 4 through 5(c). I’m expecting to get the other scans tomorrow, at which point the percentage done will go down before it goes up again, but hopefully taking care of the rest of the questions I’ve already marked some of won’t take too long. My solutions as they stand now.\n2024-04-20 22:55: I spent most of the day marking my share of the final exam in my other course, but I did make some progress on our exam after that; we are now at the grand total of 5%. Not all of the exams are scanned, so I have marked 4(a) and 4(b) on the ones I do have, and will go back and finish those same questions on the other exams when I have them (endeavouring to remember what I did so that I can be consistent).\n2024-04-19 22:00: Most of the exams are scanned, and I plan to start marking over the weekend. Our TAs will also be marking some of it. My solutions, with the Figures at the back.\n2024-04-15 12:00:\n\nAssignment 8 is graded, and I will post the marks shortly. Appeals by usual procedure between April 16 and 19.\nRules for the exam are the same as for all my exams. See note 2024-02-22 11:50 for a guide if you unsure. Expect questions from anywhere in the course, but with an emphasis on stuff that we did in lecture after the midterm.\n\n2024-04-12 15:45: pre-exam office hours on Monday from 11:00am to about 1:00pm, depending how busy things are.\n2024-04-10 17:55: Exam off for printing. It finished up as 7 questions with 40 parts and 87 points (I took a couple of things out). Coverage is everything from the lecture notes except for “durations, intervals, and periods” and also log-linear models as promised. The rules are the same as for the midterm: bring printed material as you wish (organize it or you will run out of time trying to find things), and a non-programmable non-communicating calculator if you wish. There is more explanation than coding (as is usual for this course).\n2024-04-08 21:50: I have had a busy weekend finishing off your exam. In case you are curious:\n\nthere is nothing on log-linear models as promised\nanything else from the course (that appeared in lectures) is fair game, with an emphasis on the material we talked about after the midterm\nthere are currently 7 questions with a total of 42 parts worth a total of 90 points\nI probably will do a fair amount of editing between now and sending it off for printing, but don’t expect the number of parts or points to change much.\n\n2024-04-05 13:20: Assignment 7 is marked, appeals as usual between Apr 7 and 12.\n2024-04-03 21:45: I realized (after thinking about it) that we covered log-linear modelling at too high a speed this afternoon for it to be fair to put a question on that on the final exam (so I won’t). Expect, though, one or both of principal components and factor analysis to make an appearance.\n2024-04-01 12:15: the last Monday update:\n\nI will let you know when assignments 7 and 8 are marked.\nthe last tutorial this afternoon, with something on principal components and something (maybe) on maps.\na note that leaflet maps and pdf don’t go well together (leaflet maps are actually html), so look at the html notes and PASIAS chapter for the stuff on maps.\nlecture this week: the end of principal components, factor analysis, log-linear models. (The last is like regression, but for tables of frequencies. The technique is new, but the ideas should be mainly familiar. I think this is a nice way to end the course.)\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapters 41 and 42. (We are not doing multidimensional scaling this time.)\n\n2024-03-25 10:35: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 8 (the last one!) was due last night.\nTutorial this afternoon, with something on cluster analysis.\nLecture this week: drawing maps, principal components.\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 39. I thought there was a chapter on drawing maps as well; I will have to see what happened to that.\nMy solutions to Assignment 7.\n\n2024-03-22 12:50: Assignment 4 is graded as well, marks coming your way. Appeals as usual between Mar 25 and Apr 1.\n2024-03-21 11:45: Assignments 3 and 5 are graded, and I am about to release the grades. Appeals by usual process between Mar 24 and Mar 31.\n2024-03-18 11:00: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 7 was due last night, and Assignment 8 (the last one) opens tonight.\nTutorial this afternoon on zoom, something on discriminant analysis.\nLecture this week on cluster analysis. (There is another example in the discriminant analysis notes, which you can read if you like.)\nExtra practice problems on cluster analysis: PASIAS chapters 36 and 37.\n\n2024-03-13 16:30: before I forget, from today’s class, loading MASS like this:\n\n\nlibrary(MASS, exclude = \"select\")\n\nloads the whole of MASS except for the one troublesome function select that gets tangled up with the tidyverse select, and if you load MASS this way, you don’t have to worry about the conflicted stuff. (You can also use include to say “load only these functions and no others”, which is in the same spirit as the Python from x import y).\n\n2024-03-13 11:20: my solutions to assignment 6.\n2024-03-11 10:30: Monday update:\n\nThe midterm is marked. Stats: Q1 32 (60%), median 38 (72%), Q3 43 (81%). I will be sharing the marks and the marked midterms shortly. The marks will be on Quercus, and you will be receiving an email from Crowdmark with instructions to see your marked exam.\n\nAppeals are the same procedure as for assignments, between Mar 14 and Mar 21 inclusive. Do not expect me to overrule the grader’s judgment; thus, the only thing worth appealing is an actual grading error, such as an answer where the grader didn’t mark something relevant that you wrote, after consideration of my solutions and any comments on your exam. If you have not received full marks on a question part, you should have received a comment on your exam, or it should be obvious from my solutions what is missing or in error, or both of those things. Your appeal must include a clear description of the grading error (not grading judgment). If you appeal a grading judgment, you run the risk that I regrade your whole exam and your mark may go down as well as up. My philosophy on appeals is similar to that of Jeff Rosenthal.\n\nAssignment 6 was due last night, and is open until Tuesday night (with late penalty). Assignment 7 opens tonight.\nTutorial this afternoon on zoom, with something on repeated measures.\nLecture this week: discriminant analysis, and if we have time, a start on cluster analysis.\nExtra practice problems on this week’s lecture material: PASIAS chapter 35, and Chapter 36 if we get to cluster analysis this week (which I think is unlikely).\n\n2024-03-09 21:30: Up to 89% done on the midterm. The last thing is the marking of question 1, which is happening now. (The grader was invigilating other midterms today.)\n2024-03-08 21:15: We have more exam-marking progress: we are up to 83% done. I have marked my part; we are now waiting on one of the TAs to finish their part. I have been updating my solutions as I’ve been marking. In 5(c), some of you found an answer that I wasn’t expecting but that does answer the question. If that was you, you got full credit for it.\n2024-03-07 22:15: I spent altogether too much of the evening struggling through 4(d), but that is now marked. I have updated my solutions with what I have seen while marking. We are now 61% done.\n2024-03-06 23:00: the midterms are scanned and marking is underway. We are 31% done (some of question 2, and I did most of question 3 until I ran out of juice tonight).\n2024-03-04 11:00: Monday update:\n\nthere is no TA strike. Last night, the university and the TA union came to a “tentative agreement”, which the TAs still have to vote on (so we are not safe yet), but for now there is no strike.\nMy exam solutions.\nexam marking will begin once the exams have been scanned and uploaded to Crowdmark.\ntutorial this afternoon as usual, with some problems on ANCOVA and MANOVA (don’t you love these acronyms?)\nlecture this week: repeated measures, maybe the start of discriminant analysis.\nextra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 34 (repeated measures), 35 (discriminant analysis).\nreminder that Assignment 6 is due on March 10.\n\n2024-03-01 12:20:\n\nmy solutions to Assignment 5\nif you have to miss the midterm, the weight goes automatically onto the final exam. Complete an absence declaration so that there is a record. (added 2024-03-04 11:30: if you already used your absence declaration, I do not need to see any additional documentation, but any other professors affected by your absence might, so be prepared.)\nconversely, if your final exam is better than your midterm, the final exam counts instead of your midterm.\n\n2024-02-26 11:30: Monday update:\n\nMidterm: location and date is on an announcement on Quercus labelled “Midterm”. My reply to that announcement tells you which room you need to be in.\nAssignment 5 was due last night. Assignment 6 opens tonight; you once again have 2 weeks to complete it, so that the midterm and an assignment are not due the same weekend. You may find it useful to start Assignment 6, however, as part of your midterm preparation (the material on it is on the exam).\nTutorial this afternoon. I will find something from the lecture before reading week.\nLecture this week: analysis of covariance (short), multivariate analysis of variance (longer), maybe some of repeated measures.\nIf you have questions as you prepare for the exam, post them on the Quercus discussion board or catch me after lecture.\n\n2024-02-22 11:50:\n\nAs I think I mentioned at the end of the last lecture, coverage for the midterm includes the last lecture before reading week (the “ANOVA revisited” stuff, as much as we saw in class).\nThe midterm has gone for printing. It has five questions, with a total of 23 parts worth 53 points altogether. Expect to be doing more explanation than coding (since the focus of this course is the understanding of the statistics).\nThe exam is open book, same rules as STAC32, and with the same expectation that you will organize your materials before the exam (or else you can expect to run out of time).\nSuggestion: bring a calculator to the exam (an actual calculator, not your phone). You might find it helpful in a couple of places.\nThere will be a lecture next week before the midterm. That material will not be on the midterm, but you can count on it being on the final exam (and it will help you understand what follows in the course).\nre Assignment 2, I have asked the grader to add some explanation to the grading so that you know where you didn’t get full marks. In the meanwhile, compare your answers with my solutions. The same applies to Assignment 3 and Assignment 4 that you don’t have back yet.\n\n2024-02-20 14:00: Assignment 2 is graded, and I am about to post the marks. Appeals by the usual procedure between Feb 23 and Mar 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb1153c55bd1d839d5cfc54d50fe1f522691e8145 - 2024-02-18 22:15: A Sunday night “Monday update”, to remind you that the upcoming week is Reading Week, and there is therefore no tutorial on Monday or lecture on Wednesday. (I will be spending the time sorting out your midterm.) We resume on the 26th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024-02-15 13:30: the midterm is at the end of the first week back after reading week. With that in mind, it seems best to say that we have now covered everything that could appear on the midterm (up to the end of ANOVA Revisited that we did yesterday). The material in between now and the midterm (ANCOVA, MANOVA and possibly some of repeated measures) can certainly appear on the final exam, and provides the foundation for some of the other things we do after that, so you won’t want to miss it.\n2024-02-14 13:30: a couple of things:\n\nMy solutions to Assignment 4\nThe lecture notes for ANOVA Revisited are rather long, and I won’t be talking about all of it. The beginning is review; today, I plan to start with the Rats and Vitamin B example.\n\n2024-02-12 11:25: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 4 was due last night; Assignment 5 opens tonight. You will have two weeks to do Assignment 5, since it is due on Sunday at the end of reading week.\nTutorial this afternoon on Zoom as usual. I will find a survival analysis example from PASIAS to talk about.\nLecture: there is a little more material at the end of the Survival Analysis slides that you would probably do well to look through, but this week I’ll be moving on to ANOVA Revisited. This is followed (probably after reading week) by some other ideas that are based on ANOVA: MANOVA, repeated measures, discriminant analysis and so on.\n\n2024-02-08 10:50: my solutions to assignment 3.\n2024-02-07 20:10: I updated the lecture notes to reflect what I added for class today (the slides “behind the scenes” and the one after that). This now seems to be working for both the .html and the .pdf versions of the slides.\n2024-02-05 15:15: assignment planning: there will be no assignments due during reading week or the weekend of the midterm. That means you’ll get two weeks to do each of Assignment 5 (due the Sunday night at the end of reading week) and Assignment 6 (due March 10). The eighth and final assignment will be due on March 24, so you’ll get a break at the end of the course.\n2024-02-05 11:30: Monday update:\n\nAssignments: #1 is marked, appeals by usual procedure between Feb 8 and 15; #2 is being marked; #3 was due yesterday; #4 opens tonight.\nTutorial on zoom this afternoon as usual (usual link)\nLecture this week: survival analysis. (I’ll decide whether I want to do any more of the dates and times stuff, but I think we have all we need of that.) Content warning on the survival analysis: often the data is on people that will die of something (often cancer), and we will be investigating treatments that will help them live longer, but some of them will die of whatever-it-is. I think that will take up our two hours this week.\n\n2024-02-01 10:30: My solutions to Assignment 2.\n2024-01-29 13:20: Monday update:\n\nTutorial on zoom this afternoon at 4 (link in Quercus announcement)\nAssignments: #2 was due yesterday; #3 opens tonight. I will let you know when #1 is graded.\nLecture this week:\n\nlogistic regression with multi-category but unordered response\ndates and times (in which you learn just how fiddly dates and times are to handle, and how useful it is to have packages that handle them for us)\n\nextra practice problems on this week’s material: PASIAS chapters 29 and 21 (respectively).\n\n2024-01-25 20:30: After Wednesday’s class, I decided that you might like some extra practice on the stuff we did in the first half of class (the log-odds stuff), so I added a short question on that to the next assignment. If that material is still confusing you, we can talk about that on Monday. (It is probably not giving much away to say that the second question on that assignment is on the stuff we did after half-time in class this week.)\n2024-01-25 12:20: my solutions to Assignment 1.\n2024-01-24 11:25: We have a midterm date. See the announcement on Quercus for date, time, and place (not until early March).\n2024-01-22 13:30: upcoming, this week:\n\ntutorial today at 4 on zoom, same coordinates as last week. As I write, Accuweather is telling me “periods of heavy snow for at least 60 minutes”, so I am quite happy to not be travelling today! I plan to pick a problem from PASIAS to talk about, and of course bring other questions if you have them.\nin lecture this week, some or all of:\n\nlog-odds and odds ratios and relative risk (partly in response to last week’s question about what those slope and intercept numbers actually mean)\nlogistic regression with a multi-category response when the response categories are ordered (the coal miners lung disease example)\nlogistic regression with a multi-category response when the response categories are not ordered (the brand preference example)\n\nextra examples: chapters 28 and 29 of PASIAS.\nAssignment 2, on the logistic regression stuff from last week’s lecture, opens tonight and is due next Sunday.\n\n2024-01-17 13:30: practice problems for this week’s material: PASIAS chapter 26 (edited 2024-01-18: we’ll get to chapter 27 next week).\n2024-01-15 11:15: on the agenda this week:\n\ntutorial today at 4:00pm, on zoom (link in Quercus announcement), on the regression stuff we did in lecture last week.\nThe stuff in the slides that I didn’t talk about is regression review. Read through those if you feel you need more review.\nAssignment 1 opens tonight, is due next Sunday night (the 21st), on the stuff we did in lecture last week.\nThis week’s lecture is on logistic regression. The thing that distinguishes this from regular regression is that the response variable is categorical rather than quantitative. There are three parts (that we won’t do all of this week): when the outcome is a success/failure, when the outcome is several categories but ordered, when the outcome is several categories that are not ordered. There are also variations in how the data come to us (and therefore how we have to deal with it).\nNext week’s tutorial (the 22nd) is on the stuff in this week’s lecture, and Assignment 2 (opens on the 22nd and is due on the 28th) is on the same material.\n\n2024-01-11 20:45: we have a Zoom meeting set up for Monday’s tutorial. The coordinates are in a Quercus announcement (I am not announcing it publicly).\n2024-01-11 11:45: Here is a worksheet on the material we looked at in class yesterday. I’m not promising a worksheet every week, but I will point you at some practice problems for each section of the course. Look out for information about Monday’s session tomorrow (once I have sorted that out).\n2024-01-08 12:45: Our course begins this week:\n\nexpect things to be structured a lot like they were in C32.\none two-hour lecture a week, on Wednesdays (I will give you a break in the middle). Your ACORN has the location.\none hour of tutorial-slash-office hour on Mondays, starting next week, probably on zoom.

    "text": "2024-04-25 15:00: all done, and grades submitted. They will reach you about two business days after being approved.\n2024-04-25 22:45: 90% done. A little of questions 1 and 2 are all that remain. All being well, grades tomorrow.\n2024-04-24 23:15: 78% done. What’s left is a bit of question 1, all of question 2, and a bit of question 3.\n2024-04-23 23:00: We have all the exams now (there had been a problem with uploading the other exams, but we now have them all). This means that the percent done has actually slipped back to 51% (out of a now larger number of questions to grade), but I’ve had a good day: I am caught up with questions 5 and 6 on all the exams, plus the parts of question 7 I marked yesterday. What remains for me is the last few parts of question 4 for the exams I got today, and the last few parts of question 7 for all the exams. I have worked hard at being consistent between the exams I had and the ones I got today. The course graders are marking questions 1 through 3; expect the marking to be done by about Friday, which would mean grades reaching you on Monday.\n2024-04-22 23:10: I’m now up to 7(c) on the exams I have; what remains is the rest of question 7, the other exams that are coming, and questions 1 to 3 that are being graded by the TAs. We are currently at 53%.\n2024-04-21 23:00: As I said yesterday, I don’t have all the exams scanned yet, but out of the ones I do have, we are now 25% done, and I’m done questions 4 through 5(c). I’m expecting to get the other scans tomorrow, at which point the percentage done will go down before it goes up again, but hopefully taking care of the rest of the questions I’ve already marked some of won’t take too long. My solutions as they stand now.\n2024-04-20 22:55: I spent most of the day marking my share of the final exam in my other course, but I did make some progress on our exam after that; we are now at the grand total of 5%. Not all of the exams are scanned, so I have marked 4(a) and 4(b) on the ones I do have, and will go back and finish those same questions on the other exams when I have them (endeavouring to remember what I did so that I can be consistent).\n2024-04-19 22:00: Most of the exams are scanned, and I plan to start marking over the weekend. Our TAs will also be marking some of it. My solutions, with the Figures at the back.\n2024-04-15 12:00:\n\nAssignment 8 is graded, and I will post the marks shortly. Appeals by usual procedure between April 16 and 19.\nRules for the exam are the same as for all my exams. See note 2024-02-22 11:50 for a guide if you unsure. Expect questions from anywhere in the course, but with an emphasis on stuff that we did in lecture after the midterm.\n\n2024-04-12 15:45: pre-exam office hours on Monday from 11:00am to about 1:00pm, depending how busy things are.\n2024-04-10 17:55: Exam off for printing. It finished up as 7 questions with 40 parts and 87 points (I took a couple of things out). Coverage is everything from the lecture notes except for “durations, intervals, and periods” and also log-linear models as promised. The rules are the same as for the midterm: bring printed material as you wish (organize it or you will run out of time trying to find things), and a non-programmable non-communicating calculator if you wish. There is more explanation than coding (as is usual for this course).\n2024-04-08 21:50: I have had a busy weekend finishing off your exam. In case you are curious:\n\nthere is nothing on log-linear models as promised\nanything else from the course (that appeared in lectures) is fair game, with an emphasis on the material we talked about after the midterm\nthere are currently 7 questions with a total of 42 parts worth a total of 90 points\nI probably will do a fair amount of editing between now and sending it off for printing, but don’t expect the number of parts or points to change much.\n\n2024-04-05 13:20: Assignment 7 is marked, appeals as usual between Apr 7 and 12.\n2024-04-03 21:45: I realized (after thinking about it) that we covered log-linear modelling at too high a speed this afternoon for it to be fair to put a question on that on the final exam (so I won’t). Expect, though, one or both of principal components and factor analysis to make an appearance.\n2024-04-01 12:15: the last Monday update:\n\nI will let you know when assignments 7 and 8 are marked.\nthe last tutorial this afternoon, with something on principal components and something (maybe) on maps.\na note that leaflet maps and pdf don’t go well together (leaflet maps are actually html), so look at the html notes and PASIAS chapter for the stuff on maps.\nlecture this week: the end of principal components, factor analysis, log-linear models. (The last is like regression, but for tables of frequencies. The technique is new, but the ideas should be mainly familiar. I think this is a nice way to end the course.)\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapters 41 and 42. (We are not doing multidimensional scaling this time.)\n\n2024-03-25 10:35: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 8 (the last one!) was due last night.\nTutorial this afternoon, with something on cluster analysis.\nLecture this week: drawing maps, principal components.\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 39. I thought there was a chapter on drawing maps as well; I will have to see what happened to that.\nMy solutions to Assignment 7.\n\n2024-03-22 12:50: Assignment 4 is graded as well, marks coming your way. Appeals as usual between Mar 25 and Apr 1.\n2024-03-21 11:45: Assignments 3 and 5 are graded, and I am about to release the grades. Appeals by usual process between Mar 24 and Mar 31.\n2024-03-18 11:00: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 7 was due last night, and Assignment 8 (the last one) opens tonight.\nTutorial this afternoon on zoom, something on discriminant analysis.\nLecture this week on cluster analysis. (There is another example in the discriminant analysis notes, which you can read if you like.)\nExtra practice problems on cluster analysis: PASIAS chapters 36 and 37.\n\n2024-03-13 16:30: before I forget, from today’s class, loading MASS like this:\n\n\nlibrary(MASS, exclude = \"select\")\n\nloads the whole of MASS except for the one troublesome function select that gets tangled up with the tidyverse select, and if you load MASS this way, you don’t have to worry about the conflicted stuff. (You can also use include to say “load only these functions and no others”, which is in the same spirit as the Python from x import y).\n\n2024-03-13 11:20: my solutions to assignment 6.\n2024-03-11 10:30: Monday update:\n\nThe midterm is marked. Stats: Q1 32 (60%), median 38 (72%), Q3 43 (81%). I will be sharing the marks and the marked midterms shortly. The marks will be on Quercus, and you will be receiving an email from Crowdmark with instructions to see your marked exam.\n\nAppeals are the same procedure as for assignments, between Mar 14 and Mar 21 inclusive. Do not expect me to overrule the grader’s judgment; thus, the only thing worth appealing is an actual grading error, such as an answer where the grader didn’t mark something relevant that you wrote, after consideration of my solutions and any comments on your exam. If you have not received full marks on a question part, you should have received a comment on your exam, or it should be obvious from my solutions what is missing or in error, or both of those things. Your appeal must include a clear description of the grading error (not grading judgment). If you appeal a grading judgment, you run the risk that I regrade your whole exam and your mark may go down as well as up. My philosophy on appeals is similar to that of Jeff Rosenthal.\n\nAssignment 6 was due last night, and is open until Tuesday night (with late penalty). Assignment 7 opens tonight.\nTutorial this afternoon on zoom, with something on repeated measures.\nLecture this week: discriminant analysis, and if we have time, a start on cluster analysis.\nExtra practice problems on this week’s lecture material: PASIAS chapter 35, and Chapter 36 if we get to cluster analysis this week (which I think is unlikely).\n\n2024-03-09 21:30: Up to 89% done on the midterm. The last thing is the marking of question 1, which is happening now. (The grader was invigilating other midterms today.)\n2024-03-08 21:15: We have more exam-marking progress: we are up to 83% done. I have marked my part; we are now waiting on one of the TAs to finish their part. I have been updating my solutions as I’ve been marking. In 5(c), some of you found an answer that I wasn’t expecting but that does answer the question. If that was you, you got full credit for it.\n2024-03-07 22:15: I spent altogether too much of the evening struggling through 4(d), but that is now marked. I have updated my solutions with what I have seen while marking. We are now 61% done.\n2024-03-06 23:00: the midterms are scanned and marking is underway. We are 31% done (some of question 2, and I did most of question 3 until I ran out of juice tonight).\n2024-03-04 11:00: Monday update:\n\nthere is no TA strike. Last night, the university and the TA union came to a “tentative agreement”, which the TAs still have to vote on (so we are not safe yet), but for now there is no strike.\nMy exam solutions.\nexam marking will begin once the exams have been scanned and uploaded to Crowdmark.\ntutorial this afternoon as usual, with some problems on ANCOVA and MANOVA (don’t you love these acronyms?)\nlecture this week: repeated measures, maybe the start of discriminant analysis.\nextra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 34 (repeated measures), 35 (discriminant analysis).\nreminder that Assignment 6 is due on March 10.\n\n2024-03-01 12:20:\n\nmy solutions to Assignment 5\nif you have to miss the midterm, the weight goes automatically onto the final exam. Complete an absence declaration so that there is a record. (added 2024-03-04 11:30: if you already used your absence declaration, I do not need to see any additional documentation, but any other professors affected by your absence might, so be prepared.)\nconversely, if your final exam is better than your midterm, the final exam counts instead of your midterm.\n\n2024-02-26 11:30: Monday update:\n\nMidterm: location and date is on an announcement on Quercus labelled “Midterm”. My reply to that announcement tells you which room you need to be in.\nAssignment 5 was due last night. Assignment 6 opens tonight; you once again have 2 weeks to complete it, so that the midterm and an assignment are not due the same weekend. You may find it useful to start Assignment 6, however, as part of your midterm preparation (the material on it is on the exam).\nTutorial this afternoon. I will find something from the lecture before reading week.\nLecture this week: analysis of covariance (short), multivariate analysis of variance (longer), maybe some of repeated measures.\nIf you have questions as you prepare for the exam, post them on the Quercus discussion board or catch me after lecture.\n\n2024-02-22 11:50:\n\nAs I think I mentioned at the end of the last lecture, coverage for the midterm includes the last lecture before reading week (the “ANOVA revisited” stuff, as much as we saw in class).\nThe midterm has gone for printing. It has five questions, with a total of 23 parts worth 53 points altogether. Expect to be doing more explanation than coding (since the focus of this course is the understanding of the statistics).\nThe exam is open book, same rules as STAC32, and with the same expectation that you will organize your materials before the exam (or else you can expect to run out of time).\nSuggestion: bring a calculator to the exam (an actual calculator, not your phone). You might find it helpful in a couple of places.\nThere will be a lecture next week before the midterm. That material will not be on the midterm, but you can count on it being on the final exam (and it will help you understand what follows in the course).\nre Assignment 2, I have asked the grader to add some explanation to the grading so that you know where you didn’t get full marks. In the meanwhile, compare your answers with my solutions. The same applies to Assignment 3 and Assignment 4 that you don’t have back yet.\n\n2024-02-20 14:00: Assignment 2 is graded, and I am about to post the marks. Appeals by the usual procedure between Feb 23 and Mar 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb1153c55bd1d839d5cfc54d50fe1f522691e8145 - 2024-02-18 22:15: A Sunday night “Monday update”, to remind you that the upcoming week is Reading Week, and there is therefore no tutorial on Monday or lecture on Wednesday. (I will be spending the time sorting out your midterm.) We resume on the 26th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024-02-15 13:30: the midterm is at the end of the first week back after reading week. With that in mind, it seems best to say that we have now covered everything that could appear on the midterm (up to the end of ANOVA Revisited that we did yesterday). The material in between now and the midterm (ANCOVA, MANOVA and possibly some of repeated measures) can certainly appear on the final exam, and provides the foundation for some of the other things we do after that, so you won’t want to miss it.\n2024-02-14 13:30: a couple of things:\n\nMy solutions to Assignment 4\nThe lecture notes for ANOVA Revisited are rather long, and I won’t be talking about all of it. The beginning is review; today, I plan to start with the Rats and Vitamin B example.\n\n2024-02-12 11:25: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 4 was due last night; Assignment 5 opens tonight. You will have two weeks to do Assignment 5, since it is due on Sunday at the end of reading week.\nTutorial this afternoon on Zoom as usual. I will find a survival analysis example from PASIAS to talk about.\nLecture: there is a little more material at the end of the Survival Analysis slides that you would probably do well to look through, but this week I’ll be moving on to ANOVA Revisited. This is followed (probably after reading week) by some other ideas that are based on ANOVA: MANOVA, repeated measures, discriminant analysis and so on.\n\n2024-02-08 10:50: my solutions to assignment 3.\n2024-02-07 20:10: I updated the lecture notes to reflect what I added for class today (the slides “behind the scenes” and the one after that). This now seems to be working for both the .html and the .pdf versions of the slides.\n2024-02-05 15:15: assignment planning: there will be no assignments due during reading week or the weekend of the midterm. That means you’ll get two weeks to do each of Assignment 5 (due the Sunday night at the end of reading week) and Assignment 6 (due March 10). The eighth and final assignment will be due on March 24, so you’ll get a break at the end of the course.\n2024-02-05 11:30: Monday update:\n\nAssignments: #1 is marked, appeals by usual procedure between Feb 8 and 15; #2 is being marked; #3 was due yesterday; #4 opens tonight.\nTutorial on zoom this afternoon as usual (usual link)\nLecture this week: survival analysis. (I’ll decide whether I want to do any more of the dates and times stuff, but I think we have all we need of that.) Content warning on the survival analysis: often the data is on people that will die of something (often cancer), and we will be investigating treatments that will help them live longer, but some of them will die of whatever-it-is. I think that will take up our two hours this week.\n\n2024-02-01 10:30: My solutions to Assignment 2.\n2024-01-29 13:20: Monday update:\n\nTutorial on zoom this afternoon at 4 (link in Quercus announcement)\nAssignments: #2 was due yesterday; #3 opens tonight. I will let you know when #1 is graded.\nLecture this week:\n\nlogistic regression with multi-category but unordered response\ndates and times (in which you learn just how fiddly dates and times are to handle, and how useful it is to have packages that handle them for us)\n\nextra practice problems on this week’s material: PASIAS chapters 29 and 21 (respectively).\n\n2024-01-25 20:30: After Wednesday’s class, I decided that you might like some extra practice on the stuff we did in the first half of class (the log-odds stuff), so I added a short question on that to the next assignment. If that material is still confusing you, we can talk about that on Monday. (It is probably not giving much away to say that the second question on that assignment is on the stuff we did after half-time in class this week.)\n2024-01-25 12:20: my solutions to Assignment 1.\n2024-01-24 11:25: We have a midterm date. See the announcement on Quercus for date, time, and place (not until early March).\n2024-01-22 13:30: upcoming, this week:\n\ntutorial today at 4 on zoom, same coordinates as last week. As I write, Accuweather is telling me “periods of heavy snow for at least 60 minutes”, so I am quite happy to not be travelling today! I plan to pick a problem from PASIAS to talk about, and of course bring other questions if you have them.\nin lecture this week, some or all of:\n\nlog-odds and odds ratios and relative risk (partly in response to last week’s question about what those slope and intercept numbers actually mean)\nlogistic regression with a multi-category response when the response categories are ordered (the coal miners lung disease example)\nlogistic regression with a multi-category response when the response categories are not ordered (the brand preference example)\n\nextra examples: chapters 28 and 29 of PASIAS.\nAssignment 2, on the logistic regression stuff from last week’s lecture, opens tonight and is due next Sunday.\n\n2024-01-17 13:30: practice problems for this week’s material: PASIAS chapter 26 (edited 2024-01-18: we’ll get to chapter 27 next week).\n2024-01-15 11:15: on the agenda this week:\n\ntutorial today at 4:00pm, on zoom (link in Quercus announcement), on the regression stuff we did in lecture last week.\nThe stuff in the slides that I didn’t talk about is regression review. Read through those if you feel you need more review.\nAssignment 1 opens tonight, is due next Sunday night (the 21st), on the stuff we did in lecture last week.\nThis week’s lecture is on logistic regression. The thing that distinguishes this from regular regression is that the response variable is categorical rather than quantitative. There are three parts (that we won’t do all of this week): when the outcome is a success/failure, when the outcome is several categories but ordered, when the outcome is several categories that are not ordered. There are also variations in how the data come to us (and therefore how we have to deal with it).\nNext week’s tutorial (the 22nd) is on the stuff in this week’s lecture, and Assignment 2 (opens on the 22nd and is due on the 28th) is on the same material.\n\n2024-01-11 20:45: we have a Zoom meeting set up for Monday’s tutorial. The coordinates are in a Quercus announcement (I am not announcing it publicly).\n2024-01-11 11:45: Here is a worksheet on the material we looked at in class yesterday. I’m not promising a worksheet every week, but I will point you at some practice problems for each section of the course. Look out for information about Monday’s session tomorrow (once I have sorted that out).\n2024-01-08 12:45: Our course begins this week:\n\nexpect things to be structured a lot like they were in C32.\none two-hour lecture a week, on Wednesdays (I will give you a break in the middle).

If you want more practice, especially for midterms, you can try the STAC32 old exam page.\nMy exams come with a booklet of questions (with space to write your answers). In the exam, there are references to Figures which are in a separate booklet (in the column Figures below). Print that out, or otherwise have it available as you work through each exam.\nHere are the old midterm and final exams that I have. You will notice that the best way of doing things has changed over time. Be guided by how things are done now rather than in the past.\nOne of the most effective ways to find out whether you know something is to answer questions on it. (Another way is to explain it to someone else.) Thus, your best use of these exams is to do them under exam conditions without looking at the solutions, and then look at the solutions and grade yourself. This is the fastest way to find out what you don’t understand. Read through your notes and work through examples on what you missed, then tackle another exam.\nIf all you do is read through the solutions, you have wasted a huge learning opportunity, because you will not be prepared to deal with what you face on exam day."

This means that, in 2022, you had to generate most of what would normally be a booklet of figures yourself, as on an assignment.\nI actually think the course was first run in 2020, but the exam is dated 2019, so we’ll go with that. (I remember the midterm in 2020 happening just before COVID did.)"

    "text": "bad picture\n\n\nWelcome to the home page for STAC33. This is the place to look for all things course-related (notes, announcements etc.) except for assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on Quercus.\nIn this course, we learn R, and how to use this software for data organization and to apply statistical methods that you (mostly) already know. I emphasize the communication of the results. That is to say, you need to get the answers, but you also need to be able to explain to others what the results mean, and convince others why what you have done is sensible. This is what a real-world data analyst does, and so you will need to demonstrate an ability to do that as well.\n\n\n\n\n2024-04-26 13:20: grades are on their way to you, “within two business days”, I am told.\n2024-04-25 22:45: marking is 100% done and grades are submitted (and are thus now final).\n2024-04-24 23:15: 95% done right now. All that’s left is the last two parts of question 6.\n2024-04-23 22:55: the end is near: 78% done. Remaining is a bit of question 2, a bit of question 3, and question 6. Grades on about Thursday seems about right.\n2024-04-22 23:10: 46% done as of tonight.\n2024-04-21 23:10: as of right now, we are 37% done. There are a couple of parts marked for most of the questions (all five TAs are hard at work).\n2024-04-20 22:55: progress report: 20% done. I finished my share of the marking, spending an eternity marking 7(a) for which there were a thousand and one ways to get it right (or not). There are smatterings of progress on most of the questions, as most of the graders have started their work.\n2024-04-19 21:55: the final exam has been scanned, and marking has begun. We are now at 11% done, which I think is mostly me so far. My solutions, with the Figures at the back if you need them.\n2024-04-12 15:45:\n\npre-exam office hours on Monday from 11:00am to about 1:00pm, depending how busy things are.\nfinal exam rules are the same as for the midterm (see note on 2024-02-22 12:05).\nthank you to the student who alerted me to a missing video (the second part of Bayesian analysis). This is now on the Quercus video page, numbered as “lecture 12b” (we didn’t do lecture 12c this time).\n\n2024-04-09 15:30: I think your final exam is done. For those interested: it has 8 questions with a total of 37 parts worth a total of 92 points. Some of it you will need to write code for; some of it will be written explanations.\n2024-04-04 21:00: there is now a Worksheet 11 on Stan. I don’t think this will run on r.datatools, so you’ll need to be running this on R on your own machine. Reminder that there are no tutorials on Monday (Monday is a makeup day for classes that missed a day on Good Friday).\n2024-04-04 15:10: the Stan code that I used in class. These may well download to your hard disk, and then you can do what you want with them:\n\nPoisson 1\nPoisson 2\nJumping rats\n\n2024-04-02 15:05: I got done in by having an old version of Stan. (Thanks to the student who alerted me to this.) The code that I gave you (for estimating the \\(\\lambda\\) of a Poisson distribution) no longer compiles, because the way you declare arrays in Stan has changed. In what I called poisson1.stan, in the data section, remove\n\nint x[8];\nand replace it with\narray[8] int x;\nThe new form of array declaration is the special word array, with the size of the array in square brackets after it (no space), then the type of elements in the array (here int or integer), then finally the name of the array. Likewise, in the second version of the Poisson example, you need array[n] int x; instead of int x[n];. There are also some changes to the ANOVA example (that we will see in class on Thursday); by the time you read this, the lecture notes will have updated to reflect the changes (there are a couple) that you will need to make from my original notes.\nI now have a properly updated version of all the parts to Stan.\n\n2024-04-01 12:00: the last (I think) Monday update for the semester:\n\nAssignments 6 and 8 are graded, and I will post the marks shortly. Appeals by usual process between Apr 4 and 9.\nLectures this week:\n\nfinish off the Functions stuff (we are near the end)\nBayesian statistics with Stan\n\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapters 22 and 25. (If you find yourself wanting to do vector and matrix algebra in R for other courses, the notes here should be easy enough to follow, but you don’t need that for this course. Likewise, if you want to learn more about the bootstrap, there is more material in the lecture notes that we won’t have time to cover in the course this time around.)\nI plan to put together a worksheet 11 on this week’s material. Look out for that later in the week.\n\n2024-03-28 21:00: it looks like we have a worksheet 10 for the final tutorial on Monday.\n2024-03-28 12:00: Assignment 7 has been marked. Appeals by usual procedure between Mar 31 and Apr 7. I forgot to ask someone to mark Assignment 6; that is now in progress.\n2024-03-27 12:50: ok, a Wednesday update instead:\n\nAssignment 8 was due on Sunday and closed yesterday night. My solutions. We are now done with assignments.\nLectures this week:\n\nTuesday: finish the asphalt case study plus regression with categorical variables (done)\nThursday: functions.\n\nExtra practice problems: there will be a worksheet on this stuff for next week, also PASIAS chapters 19, 20, and 22. (PASIAS also has material on dates and times, which we won’t do in this course.)\n\n2024-03-22 12:45: worksheet 9 for tutorial on Monday. The third question is on multiple regression; some of the things in it we sped through on Thursday or will not see until Tuesday next week.\n2024-03-21 15:20: for those interested, the actual Box-Cox formula says that you replace the response \\(y\\) by \\((y^\\lambda - 1)/\\lambda\\). This introduces \\(\\lambda\\) as an extra parameter, which you can estimate by maximum likelihood. The graph that we saw in lecture today is of the (profile) log-likelihood as a function of \\(\\lambda\\). If \\(\\lambda \\ne 0\\), it is a linear function of \\(y^\\lambda\\), but as \\(\\lambda \\rightarrow 0\\), \\((y^\\lambda - 1)/\\lambda \\rightarrow \\ln y\\). To see this, write \\(y^\\lambda = e^{\\lambda \\; \\ln y}\\). Remember that \\(y\\) is fixed here; think of the Box-Cox transformation as a function of \\(\\lambda\\). As \\(\\lambda\\) heads for zero, the limit becomes \\(0/0\\), so use L’Hôpital’s rule to show that the limit is \\(\\ln y\\).\n2024-03-18 11:00: Monday update:\n\nTutorial today, featuring Worksheet 8.\nAssignment 7 was due last night. Assignment 8 opens tonight and is due next Sunday night.\nLectures this week are on regression, starting with the windmill case study on Tuesday.\n\n2024-03-15 12:45:\n\nWorksheet 8 for tutorial on Monday. This will prepare you for Assignment 8, which opens on Monday night.\nAssignment 8 is the last assignment, but I will make worksheets the rest of the way, and there will be tutorials on the remaining Mondays. This is to help you get prepared for the final exam, which will definitely include some things that didn’t make it onto assignments (examples: the regression stuff we do next week, writing functions, Bayesian analysis, and anything else we get to).\n\n2024-03-13 11:20: my solutions to assignment 6.\n2024-03-12 11:00: Power went out here (on campus) for a few minutes, but is now back, whether from actual hydro or from a generator, I don’t know. So class goes ahead, as far as I know.\n2024-03-11 11:00: Monday update:\nThe midterm is marked. Stats: Q1 51.25 (76%), median 56 (83%), Q3 60 (89%). I will be sharing the marks and the marked midterms shortly. The marks will be on Quercus, and you will be receiving an email from Crowdmark with instructions to see your marked exam.\nAppeals are the same procedure as for assignments, between Mar 14 and Mar 21 inclusive. Do not expect me to overrule the grader’s judgment; thus, the only thing worth appealing is an actual grading error, such as an answer where the grader didn’t mark something relevant that you wrote, after consideration of my solutions and any comments on your exam. If you have not received full marks on a question part, you should have received a comment on your exam, or it should be obvious from my solutions what is missing or in error, or both of those things. Your appeal must include a clear description of the grading error (not grading judgment). If you appeal a grading judgment, you run the risk that I regrade your whole exam and your mark may go down as well as up. My philosophy on appeals is similar to that of Jeff Rosenthal.\nTutorials are happening today; worksheet 7. If you run out of time, as you probably will, you can leave the last question (the home prices data) until next week. - Assignment 6 was due last night. A reminder that there are no extensions, as stated in the course outline; you have the option of handing the assignment in before Tuesday night and taking the late penalty, or of counting it as one of your two worst assignments (or both). It is up to you to manage your time. - Assignment 7 opens tonight. - Lectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of tidying data (there are two other small sections of notes, “tidying extras” and “when pivot-wider goes wrong”).\nThursday: the first case study, on simple regression.\n\n2024-03-09 21:30: the end is in sight: the midterm is now 90% marked. I had a totally thrilling day getting the marking done that I assigned to myself on this exam, and I am now done. I’m not sure I shared my solutions, which are updated with extra comments on the bits that I marked.\n2024-03-08 21:15: two updates:\nthe midterm is now 62% marked. I spent today working on my other midterm, but tomorrow I plan to get to my marking on this one. The TAs are most of the way through their shares of the marking.\nthere is tutorial on Monday, in which you’ll be working on this worksheet, which will prepare you for Assignment 7 (that opens on Monday night).\n2024-03-07 22:15: a little bit of progress today: we are now at 33% done. I have been focusing on my other midterm, which I gave myself more of to mark.\n2024-03-06 23:00: the midterms are scanned and marking is underway. We are at 29% done.\n2024-03-05 13:30: the blog post about Tukey’s method that I mentioned in lecture, if you want more background.\n2024-03-04 11:00: Monday update:\nthere is no TA strike. Last night, the university and the TA union came to a “tentative agreement”, which the TAs still have to vote on (so we are not safe yet), but for now there is no strike.\non the midterm, questions 2(f) and 2(g) were impossible to answer with the information I gave you, so I have removed them from the exam (which is now out of 67 points).\nexam marking will begin once the exams have been scanned and uploaded to Crowdmark.\nreminder that there are no tutorials today. If you have not yet worked through worksheet 6, now would be a good time to do so, in preparation for Assignment 6 (which is due next Sunday night).\nlectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of analysis of variance\nThursday: tidying data - extra practice problems in PASIAS: chapter 13 (analysis of variance), chapter 17 (tidying data). The intervening chapters are on writing reports, on which there is lecture material, but I won’t be talking about that this time.\n\n2024-03-01 12:20:\n\nmy solutions to Assignment 5\nif you have to miss the midterm, the weight goes automatically onto the final exam. Complete an absence declaration so that there is a record. (added 2024-03-03 20:30: if you already used your absence declaration, I do not need to see any additional documentation, but any other professors affected by your absence might, so be prepared.)\nconversely, if your final exam is better than your midterm, the final exam counts instead of your midterm.\nthere will be no tutorials on Monday (regardless of whether the TAs are on strike) because if the TAs are working, they will be marking your midterm.\n\n2024-02-26 11:35: Monday update:\n\nMidterm time and location is on an announcement on Quercus labelled Midterm. See the notes from Feb 20 and 22 for course coverage and exam procedures.\nAssignment 5 was due last night. Assignment 6 opens tonight; you have two weeks to complete this (so that it is not due the same weekend as the midterm), but the material on it is on the midterm, so you would do well to work on it as part of your preparation.\nTutorial today, where you have the chance to ask subject-matter questions of your TAs as well as work on worksheet 6, which will prepare you for Assignment 6, which will help you prepare for the midterm.\nSee the Feb 20 note for what is on the midterm.\nLectures this week:\n\nTuesday: matched pairs sign test, Mood median test\nThursday: analysis of variance\n\nExtra practice problems in PASIAS (the chapters get out of order here):\n\nChapter 12: normal quantile plots\nChapter 11: matched pairs\nChapter 10: Mood’s median test\nChapter 13: analysis of variance.\n\nif you have questions as you prepare for the midterm, post them on the Quercus discussion board or catch me after lecture.\n\n2024-02-22 21:00: one more thing today: Worksheet 6, for tutorial on Monday. If you have subject-matter questions about the material on the exam, you can also ask your TA about those on Monday. If you have administrative questions about the exam that are not answered elsewhere, put them on the Quercus discussion board.\n2024-02-22 12:05:\n\nthe midterm is open-book. You can bring what you wish, such as your lecture notes, assignments, my slides, assignment solutions, etc, printed (no computers or other devices at the exam). You will need to organize whatever you bring, so that you can quickly find what you are looking for (and so there is an upper limit on what there is any point in bringing). If you are not well prepared, you can expect to run out of time; you will not have time to look everything up or go searching for things.\nthe exam is on its way to be printed. There are 6 questions, with a total of 30 parts worth 73 points altogether (the parts are typically worth 2 or 3 points and are about as much work as you would do on an assignment for 2 or 3 points). Expect to be writing code and explanations (for example, I might ask for code to do a task, or give you code or output and ask questions about it).\nat the exam, you will of course get an exam paper with spaces to write your answers, but you also get a booklet with numbered Figures to refer to during the exam. The exam will say things like “In Figure 10, what is…” and you will need to find Figure 10 in the other booklet.\nthis is a Crowdmark exam, so it is best to use a pen or a sharp pencil, otherwise we may have trouble reading your answers.\nlooking ahead to next week, there will be a tutorial on Monday for which there will be a worksheet (on the material from last week), and there will be lectures on Tuesday and Thursday on new material. This lecture material will not be on the midterm, but you can count on it being on the final exam, and it will help you understand what follows in the course.\n\n2024-02-20 13:40 (edit 14:05): ok, so there is a Tuesday update instead:\n\nAssignments 3 and 4 are graded, and I will post the marks in a moment. Appeals by the usual procedure, between Feb 23 and Mar 1 (for both). There was some work that was rather obviously AI-generated; I will decide whether I want to pursue academic integrity violations on any of it. A reminder that the sorts of things I ask you to do yourself on assignments are the same sorts of things you will need to do yourself on the exams, so by using anything other than your own brain and the course materials on the assignments, you are setting yourself up for failure on the exams.\nAssignment 3 appears to be graded; I will post the marks once I have confirmation from the grader. (edit: it has been graded.)\nCoverage for the midterm is what we did in lecture before reading week, up to and including the “cliffhanger” (that is to say, the matched pairs \\(t\\)-test).\n\n2024-02-18 22:15: A Sunday night “Monday update” to remind you that this upcoming week is Reading Week, so there are no tutorials tomorrow or lectures on Tuesday or Thursday. We resume on the 26th.\n2024-02-15 13:30: in what seems like a repeat of previous announcements, it is snowing, but I am here and campus is open, so class goes ahead. Today, normal quantile plots and however much of matched pairs we get to.\n2024-02-14 13:30: My solutions to Assignment 4.\n2024-02-12 10:50: Monday update:\n\ntutorials today; the worksheet.\nassignments:\n\nAssignment 2 is graded; I will release the marks shortly. Appeals by the same procedure as Assignment 1 between Feb 15 and Feb 22.\nAssignment 3 is almost graded.\nAssignment 4 was due last night. Reminders: the late penalty is 1% per hour; if you are a few minutes late, you will lose 1%, and it is not worth your time or mine to quibble about that. Also, a complete submission is the rendered version of your Quarto document; if your document does not render, it is up to you to find out why and to fix it.\nAssignment 5 opens tonight. You have two weeks to do this one (it is due on Sunday night at the end of reading week).\n\nlectures: I think I am done with power of hypothesis tests. There are some more examples in the lecture notes, which you can read if you want to gain some extra understanding.\n\nTuesday: sign test\nThursday: normal quantile plot, matched pairs\n\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 8 (power and sample size), 9 (sign test), 11 (matched pairs), 12 (normal quantile plots).\n\n2024-02-08 12:00: Worksheet 5 for Monday’s tutorial.\n2024-02-08 10:50: my solutions to Assignment 3.\n2024-02-06 11:30: On assignment 4, question 2, I was a little bit eager on the delete key! I just put back the actual question and the link to the data file, so that you now know what you were supposed to be doing. Re-download the questions from Quercus if you need to.\n2024-02-05 15:15: assignment planning: there will be no assignments due during reading week or the weekend of the midterm. That means you’ll get two weeks to do each of Assignment 5 (due the Sunday night at the end of reading week) and Assignment 6 (due March 10). The eighth and final assignment will be due on March 24, so you’ll get a break at the end of the course.\n2024-02-05 11:45: Monday update:\n\nTutorials happening today as usual; see the note three days ago for the worksheet.\nAssignments: there will be a delay in marking assignment #2 (which is my fault), but I now have graders for #2 and #3. #3 was due yesterday, but remains open until Tuesday with late penalty. #4 opens tonight.\nLectures:\n\nTuesday: the rest of the bootstrap stuff, including the code that we skipped last week.\nThursday: power of hypothesis tests. In with both of those is a procedure for how you might do simulations in general. My take is that statistical theory will only take you so far; you will run into places where the math is beyond you and simulation is the only way to understand what is happening.\n\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 8 for power. For examples of bootstrap distribution of sample mean, look in the Extras to the problems in chapters 6 and 7.\n\n2024-02-02 12:45: Worksheet 4, for tutorial on Monday.\n2024-02-01 10:30: My solutions to Assignment 2.\n2024-01-30 13:45: I was sure I had posted my solutions to assignment 1, but they seemed to have disappeared. Click the link just above to see them.\n2024-01-29 13:15: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 1 has been graded (see below for appeal procedure)\nAssignment 2 was due last night and is open (with late penalty) until Tuesday night\nAssignment 3 opens tonight, and is due next Sunday night.\nTutorials are happening today as usual; you’ll be working on worksheet 3.\nIn lectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of one-sample inference\nThursday: two-sample inference (which is a bit more complicated than you learned in B57). I might get into the bootstrap sampling distribution of the sample mean this week, or it might be next week.\n\nPractice problems for this week’s material: chapters 6 and 7 of PASIAS.\n\n2024-01-29 11:00: Assignment 1 has been graded, and I am about to post the marks.\n\nIf you wish to appeal your mark, first read sections 3.19 through 3.23 of the detailed course policies. For your appeal to be successful, you will need to demonstrate an error in the grading: that is to say, you will need to demonstrate that your work was actually correct despite not receiving full marks. Read carefully the last sentence of 3.19 as well as the whole of 3.20 in the detailed course policies. You are also warned that I have the right to regrade your entire assignment, and so your mark can go down as well as up.\nTo appeal your mark on an assignment, write me an email with the word “appeal”, the course code, and the assignment number in the subject line, for assignment 1 between February 2 and February 9 inclusive, in which you explain how there was an error in the grading of your assignment: that is to say, the grader missed something you wrote that was completely correct according to my solutions or that you argue also was a complete answer to the question. This also includes such things as addition errors in your assignment mark.\n\n2024-01-26 12:00: Worksheet 3 for tutorial on Monday. (Edit 2024-01-27 20:20: thanks to the eagle eyes of one of your TAs, a typo has been corrected.)\n2024-01-24 23:30: if you seem to be unable to create new Quarto documents, this is probably because you are running an old version of R Studio on your own computer. You can check what version you are currently running by selecting Help and About R Studio. Mine is 2023.12.0. Versions 2022.07.1 and newer include Quarto in them (including the ability to create new Quarto documents). If yours is older than that, now is a good time to upgrade.\n2024-01-24 11:25: We have a midterm date. See the announcement on Quercus for date, time, and place.\n2024-01-23 11:30: hint for one of the parts of Assignment 2: geom_line joins neighbouring points on a graph with a line.\n2024-01-22 13:40: this week:\n\nAssignment 1 was due last night, and remains open until Tuesday with late penalty.\ntutorial today, to work through Worksheet 2.\nAssignment 2, on the same material as worksheet 2, opens tonight and is due next Sunday night.\nin lectures this week:\n\nChoosing things from dataframes (this is a lot, but it goes fast)\nthe first part of statistical inference.\n\nMore practice problems: chapters 1 through about 6 of PASIAS.\n\n2024-01-18 22:00: I just took a look through the assignment 0’s that were handed in:\n\nIf you seemed to have done the right thing and I could see it including your graph, you should have 1 mark (out of 1). If you handed something in and for some reason it didn’t work, you’ll have a mark of zero plus a comment. Mostly this was that I couldn’t see your graph. If that happened to you, figure out how to fix it before you hand in assignment 1. (Hint: did you include the “embed-resources” thing described in 2(j) on Worksheet 1? If you had re-downloaded the file you handed in, you would have been able to see that your graph did not make it.)\nYou can have as many attempts at Assignment 0 as you wish. If you didn’t get it the first time, I encourage you to have another go. I intend to take a look in the next day or two at any more that are handed in since I looked just now.\nMy past experience is that most of the people who have trouble handing in Assignment 1 properly did not even attempt assignment 0. You have a free chance here to make sure that you understand the procedure.\n\n2024-01-18 15:30:\n\nWorksheet 2, on this week’s material, for tutorial on Monday.\nThe waitlist for this course is now closed. The course is full, so I will not enrol any extra people in the class (and bear in mind that everyone on the waitlist wanted to get into the course, so your reasons for getting in are not special). If you didn’t make it this year, you are welcome to try again next year, but be aware that you will need to register as early as possible. I try to save some places for 4th years (by UTSC’s definition: 14 or more credits).\n\n2024-01-15 11:00: On the agenda this week:\n\nAssignment 1, on the stuff you are doing on the worksheet today, will open tonight and be due next Sunday night (the 21st).\nLectures:\n\nmaking graphs (Tuesday)\nnumerical summaries, choosing things from dataframes (start) (Thursday)\n\nnext week’s tutorial (on Monday, a week from today) will feature a worksheet on the things in this week’s lectures.\nAssignment 2 (opening Monday next week) will also be on those things.\n\n2024-01-15 09:30: reminder: your tutorial is today, for practice on Worksheet 1 and handing in “Assignment 0” (the first “real assignment” will be due next week).\n2024-01-11 15:15:\n\nWorksheet 1, for practice on this week’s material.\nThe two datafiles I forgot earlier: coffee.txt, migraine.txt. You should be able to find course datafiles at a URL like http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/filename.txt where you replace filename.txt by whatever the file is called.\n\n2024-01-11 11:45: looking out of my office window, I might as well repeat Tuesday’s announcement!\n\nafter today’s lecture, I will post Worksheet 1, which gives you a chance to work through some of the stuff we’ve seen so far. You can work through it during tutorial, or before (and bring any problems or confusions to tutorial).\nAssignment 1 will open after Monday’s tutorial, and will be due the following Sunday night (Jan 21). Expect the same structure each week: working through the worksheet, with help available in tutorial, will prepare you for the next assignment, and doing the assignments (yourself!) will prepare you for the exams.\nData files for today’s lecture: test1.xls, test1.csv, test2.xls\n\n2024-01-09 10:40: campus is open, I am here, and the weather looks worse than it actually is, so class goes ahead today. On the agenda for this week:\n\ntoday: course outline and running R\nThursday: reading data from files.\n\n2024-01-08 12:25: first lecture is tomorrow; your ACORN has the location. Here is a short description of how things will go:\n\nTwo one-hour lectures a week, Tuesday and Thursday. I will have office hours after each lecture, or you can talk with me at the end of lecture, or you can post in the Quercus discussions for the course.\nYou should be registered in one of the three tutorials (on Mondays, starting next week, in week 2 of classes).\nIn tutorial, you will get a worksheet to work through yourself (with my answers and extra discussion). There will be at least one TA in attendance. Ask for help if you get stuck or confused.\nThere will be weekly assignments, with the first one opening on January 15 after tutorial (and due the following Sunday night). There will be about eight assignments altogether, with no assignments due during reading week or around the midterm.\nEach item helps you with the next on the list: doing the worksheet will help you with the corresponding assignment, and doing the assignments will help you with the exams.\nThe first part of the lecture notes contains the course outline. Read this now, to get a more detailed idea of what to expect.\n\n2024-01-03 11:10: lecture 1 is just under a week away. I am assuming that you are completely familiar with basic statistical techniques, such as:\n\nwhat graphs are available to you for each kind of data, and how to interpret them\nwhat a hypothesis test does and does not do\ntests for one and two and more than two means (\\(t\\)-tests for the first two and ANOVA for the third)\nhow to apply all of these to data and to interpret the results\nbasic probability distributions\nwe will learn how to do all of the above in R (I assume you know nothing about R).\n\nThere is very little actual math in this course, but there are a lot of ideas, and there is a lot of explanation of those ideas as they apply to data. Thus, you need to understand the theory that you have learned, but you also need to know how it applies to the data in front of you.\nIf you have learned some R before, you may see that I do things differently from what you learned before. I am expecting you to do things in this course as I teach them. All the work in this course can be done using ideas from this course, except where I say otherwise.\n2023-12-14 14:05: I found room for a few more students, 4th years in either our Major or Specialist programs. I know there are not very many C or D level courses in the winter semester, so these seemed to be the people whose need was greatest.\n2023-12-12 16:30: I’ve been doing some planning for this course. Here’s what to expect:\n\nlectures Tuesday and Thursday (1 hour each)\ntutorial Monday, in a computer lab, in which you will get a worksheet to work through on the material from the previous week’s lecture, with a TA or two around to help if you get stuck or confused. Tutorials start in week 2.\nweekly assignments open on Monday night, on the same material as the worksheet you just did, and are due the following Sunday night. The first assignment will open in week 2.\nthere will be about 8 assignments.\na midterm (2 hours) and a final exam (3 hours) as usual, on dates to be announced. I will move any assignments with due dates close to the midterm, as needed. My exams are always open book.\nthe worksheets will help you with the assignments, and the assignments will help you with the exams, provided you do them yourself.\n\n2023-08-10 13:30: I have asked to add some students to the course. These are all UTSC students, 4th years who joined the waitlist before August 9, and 3rd years who joined the waitlist before 10:30am on July 11. If you are still on the waitlist after this has been processed, you will have to take your chances.\n\n2024-03-15 12:45:\n\nWorksheet 8 for tutorial on Monday. This will prepare you for Assignment 8, which opens on Monday night.\nAssignment 8 is the last assignment, but I will make worksheets the rest of the way, and there will be tutorials on the remaining Mondays. This is to help you get prepared for the final exam, which will definitely include some things that didn’t make it onto assignments (examples: the regression stuff we do next week, writing functions, Bayesian analysis, and anything else we get to).\n\n2024-03-13 11:20: my solutions to assignment 6.\n2024-03-12 11:00: Power went out here (on campus) for a few minutes, but is now back, whether from actual hydro or from a generator, I don’t know. So class goes ahead, as far as I know.\n2024-03-11 11:00: Monday update:\n\nThe midterm is marked. Stats: Q1 51.25 (76%), median 56 (83%), Q3 60 (89%). I will be sharing the marks and the marked midterms shortly. The marks will be on Quercus, and you will be receiving an email from Crowdmark with instructions to see your marked exam.\n\nAppeals are the same procedure as for assignments, between Mar 14 and Mar 21 inclusive. Do not expect me to overrule the grader’s judgment; thus, the only thing worth appealing is an actual grading error, such as an answer where the grader didn’t mark something relevant that you wrote, after consideration of my solutions and any comments on your exam. If you have not received full marks on a question part, you should have received a comment on your exam, or it should be obvious from my solutions what is missing or in error, or both of those things. Your appeal must include a clear description of the grading error (not grading judgment). If you appeal a grading judgment, you run the risk that I regrade your whole exam and your mark may go down as well as up. My philosophy on appeals is similar to that of Jeff Rosenthal.\n\nTutorials are happening today; worksheet 7. If you run out of time, as you probably will, you can leave the last question (the home prices data) until next week.\nAssignment 6 was due last night. A reminder that there are no extensions, as stated in the course outline; you have the option of handing the assignment in before Tuesday night and taking the late penalty, or of counting it as one of your two worst assignments (or both). It is up to you to manage your time.\nAssignment 7 opens tonight.\nLectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of tidying data (there are two other small sections of notes, “tidying extras” and “when pivot-wider goes wrong”).\nThursday: the first case study, on simple regression.\n\n\n2024-03-09 21:30: the end is in sight: the midterm is now 90% marked. I had a totally thrilling day getting the marking done that I assigned to myself on this exam, and I am now done. I’m not sure I shared my solutions, which are updated with extra comments on the bits that I marked.\n2024-03-08 21:15: two updates:\n\nthe midterm is now 62% marked. I spent today working on my other midterm, but tomorrow I plan to get to my marking on this one. The TAs are most of the way through their shares of the marking.\nthere is tutorial on Monday, in which you’ll be working on this worksheet, which will prepare you for Assignment 7 (that opens on Monday night).\n\n2024-03-07 22:15: a little bit of progress today: we are now at 33% done. I have been focusing on my other midterm, which I gave myself more of to mark.\n2024-03-06 23:00: the midterms are scanned and marking is underway. We are at 29% done.\n2024-03-05 13:30: the blog post about Tukey’s method that I mentioned in lecture, if you want more background.\n2024-03-04 11:00: Monday update:\n\nthere is no TA strike. Last night, the university and the TA union came to a “tentative agreement”, which the TAs still have to vote on (so we are not safe yet), but for now there is no strike.\non the midterm, questions 2(f) and 2(g) were impossible to answer with the information I gave you, so I have removed them from the exam (which is now out of 67 points).\nexam marking will begin once the exams have been scanned and uploaded to Crowdmark.\nreminder that there are no tutorials today. If you have not yet worked through worksheet 6, now would be a good time to do so, in preparation for Assignment 6 (which is due next Sunday night).\nlectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of analysis of variance\nThursday: tidying data\n\nextra practice problems in PASIAS: chapter 13 (analysis of variance), chapter 17 (tidying data). The intervening chapters are on writing reports, on which there is lecture material, but I won’t be talking about that this time.\n\n2024-03-01 12:20:\n\nmy solutions to Assignment 5\nif you have to miss the midterm, the weight goes automatically onto the final exam. Complete an absence declaration so that there is a record. (added 2024-03-03 20:30: if you already used your absence declaration, I do not need to see any additional documentation, but any other professors affected by your absence might, so be prepared.)\nconversely, if your final exam is better than your midterm, the final exam counts instead of your midterm.\nthere will be no tutorials on Monday (regardless of whether the TAs are on strike) because if the TAs are working, they will be marking your midterm.\n\n2024-02-26 11:35: Monday update:\n\nMidterm time and location is on an announcement on Quercus labelled Midterm. See the notes from Feb 20 and 22 for course coverage and exam procedures.\nAssignment 5 was due last night. Assignment 6 opens tonight; you have two weeks to complete this (so that it is not due the same weekend as the midterm), but the material on it is on the midterm, so you would do well to work on it as part of your preparation.\nTutorial today, where you have the chance to ask subject-matter questions of your TAs as well as work on worksheet 6, which will prepare you for Assignment 6, which will help you prepare for the midterm.\nSee the Feb 20 note for what is on the midterm.\nLectures this week:\n\nTuesday: matched pairs sign test, Mood median test\nThursday: analysis of variance\n\nExtra practice problems in PASIAS (the chapters get out of order here):\n\nChapter 12: normal quantile plots\nChapter 11: matched pairs\nChapter 10: Mood’s median test\nChapter 13: analysis of variance.\n\nif you have questions as you prepare for the midterm, post them on the Quercus discussion board or catch me after lecture.\n\n2024-02-22 21:00: one more thing today: Worksheet 6, for tutorial on Monday. If you have subject-matter questions about the material on the exam, you can also ask your TA about those on Monday. If you have administrative questions about the exam that are not answered elsewhere, put them on the Quercus discussion board.\n2024-02-22 12:05:\n\nthe midterm is open-book. You can bring what you wish, such as your lecture notes, assignments, my slides, assignment solutions, etc, printed (no computers or other devices at the exam). You will need to organize whatever you bring, so that you can quickly find what you are looking for (and so there is an upper limit on what there is any point in bringing). If you are not well prepared, you can expect to run out of time; you will not have time to look everything up or go searching for things.\nthe exam is on its way to be printed. There are 6 questions, with a total of 30 parts worth 73 points altogether (the parts are typically worth 2 or 3 points and are about as much work as you would do on an assignment for 2 or 3 points). Expect to be writing code and explanations (for example, I might ask for code to do a task, or give you code or output and ask questions about it).\nat the exam, you will of course get an exam paper with spaces to write your answers, but you also get a booklet with numbered Figures to refer to during the exam. The exam will say things like “In Figure 10, what is…” and you will need to find Figure 10 in the other booklet.\nthis is a Crowdmark exam, so it is best to use a pen or a sharp pencil, otherwise we may have trouble reading your answers.\nlooking ahead to next week, there will be a tutorial on Monday for which there will be a worksheet (on the material from last week), and there will be lectures on Tuesday and Thursday on new material. This lecture material will not be on the midterm, but you can count on it being on the final exam, and it will help you understand what follows in the course.\n\n2024-02-20 13:40 (edit 14:05): ok, so there is a Tuesday update instead:\n\nAssignments 3 and 4 are graded, and I will post the marks in a moment. Appeals by the usual procedure, between Feb 23 and Mar 1 (for both). There was some work that was rather obviously AI-generated; I will decide whether I want to pursue academic integrity violations on any of it. A reminder that the sorts of things I ask you to do yourself on assignments are the same sorts of things you will need to do yourself on the exams, so by using anything other than your own brain and the course materials on the assignments, you are setting yourself up for failure on the exams.\nAssignment 3 appears to be graded; I will post the marks once I have confirmation from the grader. (edit: it has been graded.)\nCoverage for the midterm is what we did in lecture before reading week, up to and including the “cliffhanger” (that is to say, the matched pairs \\(t\\)-test).\n\n2024-02-18 22:15: A Sunday night “Monday update” to remind you that this upcoming week is Reading Week, so there are no tutorials tomorrow or lectures on Tuesday or Thursday. We resume on the 26th.\n2024-02-15 13:30: in what seems like a repeat of previous announcements, it is snowing, but I am here and campus is open, so class goes ahead. Today, normal quantile plots and however much of matched pairs we get to.\n2024-02-14 13:30: My solutions to Assignment 4.\n2024-02-12 10:50: Monday update:\n\ntutorials today; the worksheet.\nassignments:\n\nAssignment 2 is graded; I will release the marks shortly. Appeals by the same procedure as Assignment 1 between Feb 15 and Feb 22.\nAssignment 3 is almost graded.\nAssignment 4 was due last night. Reminders: the late penalty is 1% per hour; if you are a few minutes late, you will lose 1%, and it is not worth your time or mine to quibble about that. Also, a complete submission is the rendered version of your Quarto document; if your document does not render, it is up to you to find out why and to fix it.\nAssignment 5 opens tonight. You have two weeks to do this one (it is due on Sunday night at the end of reading week).\n\nlectures: I think I am done with power of hypothesis tests. There are some more examples in the lecture notes, which you can read if you want to gain some extra understanding.\n\nTuesday: sign test\nThursday: normal quantile plot, matched pairs\n\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 8 (power and sample size), 9 (sign test), 11 (matched pairs), 12 (normal quantile plots).\n\n2024-02-08 12:00: Worksheet 5 for Monday’s tutorial.\n2024-02-08 10:50: my solutions to Assignment 3.\n2024-02-06 11:30: On assignment 4, question 2, I was a little bit eager on the delete key! I just put back the actual question and the link to the data file, so that you now know what you were supposed to be doing. Re-download the questions from Quercus if you need to.\n2024-02-05 15:15: assignment planning: there will be no assignments due during reading week or the weekend of the midterm. That means you’ll get two weeks to do each of Assignment 5 (due the Sunday night at the end of reading week) and Assignment 6 (due March 10). The eighth and final assignment will be due on March 24, so you’ll get a break at the end of the course.\n2024-02-05 11:45: Monday update:\n\nTutorials happening today as usual; see the note three days ago for the worksheet.\nAssignments: there will be a delay in marking assignment #2 (which is my fault), but I now have graders for #2 and #3. #3 was due yesterday, but remains open until Tuesday with late penalty. #4 opens tonight.\nLectures:\n\nTuesday: the rest of the bootstrap stuff, including the code that we skipped last week.\nThursday: power of hypothesis tests. In with both of those is a procedure for how you might do simulations in general. My take is that statistical theory will only take you so far; you will run into places where the math is beyond you and simulation is the only way to understand what is happening.\n\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 8 for power. For examples of bootstrap distribution of sample mean, look in the Extras to the problems in chapters 6 and 7.\n\n2024-02-02 12:45: Worksheet 4, for tutorial on Monday.\n2024-02-01 10:30: My solutions to Assignment 2.\n2024-01-30 13:45: I was sure I had posted my solutions to assignment 1, but they seemed to have disappeared. Click the link just above to see them.\n2024-01-29 13:15: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 1 has been graded (see below for appeal procedure)\nAssignment 2 was due last night and is open (with late penalty) until Tuesday night\nAssignment 3 opens tonight, and is due next Sunday night.\nTutorials are happening today as usual; you’ll be working on worksheet 3.\nIn lectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of one-sample inference\nThursday: two-sample inference (which is a bit more complicated than you learned in B57). I might get into the bootstrap sampling distribution of the sample mean this week, or it might be next week.\n\nPractice problems for this week’s material: chapters 6 and 7 of PASIAS.\n\n2024-01-29 11:00: Assignment 1 has been graded, and I am about to post the marks.\n\nIf you wish to appeal your mark, first read sections 3.19 through 3.23 of the detailed course policies. For your appeal to be successful, you will need to demonstrate an error in the grading: that is to say, you will need to demonstrate that your work was actually correct despite not receiving full marks. Read carefully the last sentence of 3.19 as well as the whole of 3.20 in the detailed course policies. You are also warned that I have the right to regrade your entire assignment, and so your mark can go down as well as up.\nTo appeal your mark on an assignment, write me an email with the word “appeal”, the course code, and the assignment number in the subject line, for assignment 1 between February 2 and February 9 inclusive, in which you explain how there was an error in the grading of your assignment: that is to say, the grader missed something you wrote that was completely correct according to my solutions or that you argue also was a complete answer to the question. This also includes such things as addition errors in your assignment mark.\n\n2024-01-26 12:00: Worksheet 3 for tutorial on Monday. (Edit 2024-01-27 20:20: thanks to the eagle eyes of one of your TAs, a typo has been corrected.)\n2024-01-24 23:30: if you seem to be unable to create new Quarto documents, this is probably because you are running an old version of R Studio on your own computer. You can check what version you are currently running by selecting Help and About R Studio. Mine is 2023.12.0. Versions 2022.07.1 and newer include Quarto in them (including the ability to create new Quarto documents). If yours is older than that, now is a good time to upgrade.\n2024-01-24 11:25: We have a midterm date. See the announcement on Quercus for date, time, and place.\n2024-01-23 11:30: hint for one of the parts of Assignment 2: geom_line joins neighbouring points on a graph with a line.\n2024-01-22 13:40: this week:\n\nAssignment 1 was due last night, and remains open until Tuesday with late penalty.\ntutorial today, to work through Worksheet 2.\nAssignment 2, on the same material as worksheet 2, opens tonight and is due next Sunday night.\nin lectures this week:\n\nChoosing things from dataframes (this is a lot, but it goes fast)\nthe first part of statistical inference.\n\nMore practice problems: chapters 1 through about 6 of PASIAS.\n\n2024-01-18 22:00: I just took a look through the assignment 0’s that were handed in:\n\nIf you seemed to have done the right thing and I could see it including your graph, you should have 1 mark (out of 1).

I know there are not very many C or D level courses in the winter semester, so these seemed to be the people whose need was greatest.\n2023-12-12 16:30: I’ve been doing some planning for this course. Here’s what to expect:\n\nlectures Tuesday and Thursday (1 hour each)\ntutorial Monday, in a computer lab, in which you will get a worksheet to work through on the material from the previous week’s lecture, with a TA or two around to help if you get stuck or confused. Tutorials start in week 2.\nweekly assignments open on Monday night, on the same material as the worksheet you just did, and are due the following Sunday night. The first assignment will open in week 2.\nthere will be about 8 assignments.\na midterm (2 hours) and a final exam (3 hours) as usual, on dates to be announced. I will move any assignments with due dates close to the midterm, as needed. My exams are always open book.\nthe worksheets will help you with the assignments, and the assignments will help you with the exams, provided you do them yourself.\n\n2023-08-10 13:30: I have asked to add some students to the course. These are all UTSC students, 4th years who joined the waitlist before August 9, and 3rd years who joined the waitlist before 10:30am on July 11. If you are still on the waitlist after this has been processed, you will have to take your chances.\n2023-08-10 12:50: I am aware that the course has a longish waitlist. I have room to add a few more students. I will be prioritizing 4th years, since I know that majors/minors/specialists require a certain number of upper-level courses to complete their programs. If there is room to admit 3rd years, I will do so in the order that they joined the waitlist. This is (historically) a popular class, and it is up to you to register for it as early as possible if you want to get in. Do not appeal to me for special treatment. The choice of students to add is mine."

This is the place to look for all things course-related (notes, announcements etc.) except for assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on Quercus.\nIn this course, we learn R, and how to use this software for data organization and to apply statistical methods that you (mostly) already know. I emphasize the communication of the results. That is to say, you need to get the answers, but you also need to be able to explain to others what the results mean, and convince others why what you have done is sensible. This is what a real-world data analyst does, and so you will need to demonstrate an ability to do that as well."

    "text": "2024-04-26 13:20: grades are on their way to you, “within two business days”, I am told.\n2024-04-25 22:45: marking is 100% done and grades are submitted (and are thus now final).\n2024-04-24 23:15: 95% done right now. All that’s left is the last two parts of question 6.\n2024-04-23 22:55: the end is near: 78% done. Remaining is a bit of question 2, a bit of question 3, and question 6. Grades on about Thursday seems about right.\n2024-04-22 23:10: 46% done as of tonight.\n2024-04-21 23:10: as of right now, we are 37% done. There are a couple of parts marked for most of the questions (all five TAs are hard at work).\n2024-04-20 22:55: progress report: 20% done. I finished my share of the marking, spending an eternity marking 7(a) for which there were a thousand and one ways to get it right (or not). There are smatterings of progress on most of the questions, as most of the graders have started their work.\n2024-04-19 21:55: the final exam has been scanned, and marking has begun. We are now at 11% done, which I think is mostly me so far. My solutions, with the Figures at the back if you need them.\n2024-04-12 15:45:\n\npre-exam office hours on Monday from 11:00am to about 1:00pm, depending how busy things are.\nfinal exam rules are the same as for the midterm (see note on 2024-02-22 12:05).\nthank you to the student who alerted me to a missing video (the second part of Bayesian analysis). This is now on the Quercus video page, numbered as “lecture 12b” (we didn’t do lecture 12c this time).\n\n2024-04-09 15:30: I think your final exam is done. For those interested: it has 8 questions with a total of 37 parts worth a total of 92 points. Some of it you will need to write code for; some of it will be written explanations.\n2024-04-04 21:00: there is now a Worksheet 11 on Stan. I don’t think this will run on r.datatools, so you’ll need to be running this on R on your own machine. Reminder that there are no tutorials on Monday (Monday is a makeup day for classes that missed a day on Good Friday).\n2024-04-04 15:10: the Stan code that I used in class. These may well download to your hard disk, and then you can do what you want with them:\n\nPoisson 1\nPoisson 2\nJumping rats\n\n2024-04-02 15:05: I got done in by having an old version of Stan. (Thanks to the student who alerted me to this.) The code that I gave you (for estimating the \\(\\lambda\\) of a Poisson distribution) no longer compiles, because the way you declare arrays in Stan has changed. In what I called poisson1.stan, in the data section, remove\n\nint x[8];\nand replace it with\narray[8] int x;\nThe new form of array declaration is the special word array, with the size of the array in square brackets after it (no space), then the type of elements in the array (here int or integer), then finally the name of the array. Likewise, in the second version of the Poisson example, you need array[n] int x; instead of int x[n];. There are also some changes to the ANOVA example (that we will see in class on Thursday); by the time you read this, the lecture notes will have updated to reflect the changes (there are a couple) that you will need to make from my original notes.\nI now have a properly updated version of all the parts to Stan.\n\n2024-04-01 12:00: the last (I think) Monday update for the semester:\n\nAssignments 6 and 8 are graded, and I will post the marks shortly. Appeals by usual process between Apr 4 and 9.\nLectures this week:\n\nfinish off the Functions stuff (we are near the end)\nBayesian statistics with Stan\n\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapters 22 and 25. (If you find yourself wanting to do vector and matrix algebra in R for other courses, the notes here should be easy enough to follow, but you don’t need that for this course. Likewise, if you want to learn more about the bootstrap, there is more material in the lecture notes that we won’t have time to cover in the course this time around.)\nI plan to put together a worksheet 11 on this week’s material. Look out for that later in the week.\n\n2024-03-28 21:00: it looks like we have a worksheet 10 for the final tutorial on Monday.\n2024-03-28 12:00: Assignment 7 has been marked. Appeals by usual procedure between Mar 31 and Apr 7. I forgot to ask someone to mark Assignment 6; that is now in progress.\n2024-03-27 12:50: ok, a Wednesday update instead:\n\nAssignment 8 was due on Sunday and closed yesterday night. My solutions. We are now done with assignments.\nLectures this week:\n\nTuesday: finish the asphalt case study plus regression with categorical variables (done)\nThursday: functions.\n\nExtra practice problems: there will be a worksheet on this stuff for next week, also PASIAS chapters 19, 20, and 22. (PASIAS also has material on dates and times, which we won’t do in this course.)\n\n2024-03-22 12:45: worksheet 9 for tutorial on Monday. The third question is on multiple regression; some of the things in it we sped through on Thursday or will not see until Tuesday next week.\n2024-03-21 15:20: for those interested, the actual Box-Cox formula says that you replace the response \\(y\\) by \\((y^\\lambda - 1)/\\lambda\\). This introduces \\(\\lambda\\) as an extra parameter, which you can estimate by maximum likelihood. The graph that we saw in lecture today is of the (profile) log-likelihood as a function of \\(\\lambda\\). If \\(\\lambda \\ne 0\\), it is a linear function of \\(y^\\lambda\\), but as \\(\\lambda \\rightarrow 0\\), \\((y^\\lambda - 1)/\\lambda \\rightarrow \\ln y\\). To see this, write \\(y^\\lambda = e^{\\lambda \\; \\ln y}\\). Remember that \\(y\\) is fixed here; think of the Box-Cox transformation as a function of \\(\\lambda\\). As \\(\\lambda\\) heads for zero, the limit becomes \\(0/0\\), so use L’Hôpital’s rule to show that the limit is \\(\\ln y\\).\n2024-03-18 11:00: Monday update:\n\nTutorial today, featuring Worksheet 8.\nAssignment 7 was due last night. Assignment 8 opens tonight and is due next Sunday night.\nLectures this week are on regression, starting with the windmill case study on Tuesday.\n\n2024-03-15 12:45:\n\nWorksheet 8 for tutorial on Monday. This will prepare you for Assignment 8, which opens on Monday night.\nAssignment 8 is the last assignment, but I will make worksheets the rest of the way, and there will be tutorials on the remaining Mondays. This is to help you get prepared for the final exam, which will definitely include some things that didn’t make it onto assignments (examples: the regression stuff we do next week, writing functions, Bayesian analysis, and anything else we get to).\n\n2024-03-13 11:20: my solutions to assignment 6.\n2024-03-12 11:00: Power went out here (on campus) for a few minutes, but is now back, whether from actual hydro or from a generator, I don’t know. So class goes ahead, as far as I know.\n2024-03-11 11:00: Monday update:\nThe midterm is marked. Stats: Q1 51.25 (76%), median 56 (83%), Q3 60 (89%). I will be sharing the marks and the marked midterms shortly. The marks will be on Quercus, and you will be receiving an email from Crowdmark with instructions to see your marked exam.\nAppeals are the same procedure as for assignments, between Mar 14 and Mar 21 inclusive. Do not expect me to overrule the grader’s judgment; thus, the only thing worth appealing is an actual grading error, such as an answer where the grader didn’t mark something relevant that you wrote, after consideration of my solutions and any comments on your exam. If you have not received full marks on a question part, you should have received a comment on your exam, or it should be obvious from my solutions what is missing or in error, or both of those things. Your appeal must include a clear description of the grading error (not grading judgment). If you appeal a grading judgment, you run the risk that I regrade your whole exam and your mark may go down as well as up. My philosophy on appeals is similar to that of Jeff Rosenthal.\nTutorials are happening today; worksheet 7. If you run out of time, as you probably will, you can leave the last question (the home prices data) until next week. - Assignment 6 was due last night. A reminder that there are no extensions, as stated in the course outline; you have the option of handing the assignment in before Tuesday night and taking the late penalty, or of counting it as one of your two worst assignments (or both). It is up to you to manage your time. - Assignment 7 opens tonight. - Lectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of tidying data (there are two other small sections of notes, “tidying extras” and “when pivot-wider goes wrong”).\nThursday: the first case study, on simple regression.\n\n2024-03-09 21:30: the end is in sight: the midterm is now 90% marked. I had a totally thrilling day getting the marking done that I assigned to myself on this exam, and I am now done. I’m not sure I shared my solutions, which are updated with extra comments on the bits that I marked.\n2024-03-08 21:15: two updates:\nthe midterm is now 62% marked. I spent today working on my other midterm, but tomorrow I plan to get to my marking on this one. The TAs are most of the way through their shares of the marking.\nthere is tutorial on Monday, in which you’ll be working on this worksheet, which will prepare you for Assignment 7 (that opens on Monday night).\n2024-03-07 22:15: a little bit of progress today: we are now at 33% done. I have been focusing on my other midterm, which I gave myself more of to mark.\n2024-03-06 23:00: the midterms are scanned and marking is underway. We are at 29% done.\n2024-03-05 13:30: the blog post about Tukey’s method that I mentioned in lecture, if you want more background.\n2024-03-04 11:00: Monday update:\nthere is no TA strike. Last night, the university and the TA union came to a “tentative agreement”, which the TAs still have to vote on (so we are not safe yet), but for now there is no strike.\non the midterm, questions 2(f) and 2(g) were impossible to answer with the information I gave you, so I have removed them from the exam (which is now out of 67 points).\nexam marking will begin once the exams have been scanned and uploaded to Crowdmark.\nreminder that there are no tutorials today. If you have not yet worked through worksheet 6, now would be a good time to do so, in preparation for Assignment 6 (which is due next Sunday night).\nlectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of analysis of variance\nThursday: tidying data - extra practice problems in PASIAS: chapter 13 (analysis of variance), chapter 17 (tidying data). The intervening chapters are on writing reports, on which there is lecture material, but I won’t be talking about that this time.\n\n2024-03-01 12:20:\n\nmy solutions to Assignment 5\nif you have to miss the midterm, the weight goes automatically onto the final exam. Complete an absence declaration so that there is a record. (added 2024-03-03 20:30: if you already used your absence declaration, I do not need to see any additional documentation, but any other professors affected by your absence might, so be prepared.)\nconversely, if your final exam is better than your midterm, the final exam counts instead of your midterm.\nthere will be no tutorials on Monday (regardless of whether the TAs are on strike) because if the TAs are working, they will be marking your midterm.\n\n2024-02-26 11:35: Monday update:\n\nMidterm time and location is on an announcement on Quercus labelled Midterm. See the notes from Feb 20 and 22 for course coverage and exam procedures.\nAssignment 5 was due last night. Assignment 6 opens tonight; you have two weeks to complete this (so that it is not due the same weekend as the midterm), but the material on it is on the midterm, so you would do well to work on it as part of your preparation.\nTutorial today, where you have the chance to ask subject-matter questions of your TAs as well as work on worksheet 6, which will prepare you for Assignment 6, which will help you prepare for the midterm.\nSee the Feb 20 note for what is on the midterm.\nLectures this week:\n\nTuesday: matched pairs sign test, Mood median test\nThursday: analysis of variance\n\nExtra practice problems in PASIAS (the chapters get out of order here):\n\nChapter 12: normal quantile plots\nChapter 11: matched pairs\nChapter 10: Mood’s median test\nChapter 13: analysis of variance.\n\nif you have questions as you prepare for the midterm, post them on the Quercus discussion board or catch me after lecture.\n\n2024-02-22 21:00: one more thing today: Worksheet 6, for tutorial on Monday. If you have subject-matter questions about the material on the exam, you can also ask your TA about those on Monday. If you have administrative questions about the exam that are not answered elsewhere, put them on the Quercus discussion board.\n2024-02-22 12:05:\n\nthe midterm is open-book. You can bring what you wish, such as your lecture notes, assignments, my slides, assignment solutions, etc, printed (no computers or other devices at the exam). You will need to organize whatever you bring, so that you can quickly find what you are looking for (and so there is an upper limit on what there is any point in bringing). If you are not well prepared, you can expect to run out of time; you will not have time to look everything up or go searching for things.\nthe exam is on its way to be printed. There are 6 questions, with a total of 30 parts worth 73 points altogether (the parts are typically worth 2 or 3 points and are about as much work as you would do on an assignment for 2 or 3 points). Expect to be writing code and explanations (for example, I might ask for code to do a task, or give you code or output and ask questions about it).\nat the exam, you will of course get an exam paper with spaces to write your answers, but you also get a booklet with numbered Figures to refer to during the exam. The exam will say things like “In Figure 10, what is…” and you will need to find Figure 10 in the other booklet.\nthis is a Crowdmark exam, so it is best to use a pen or a sharp pencil, otherwise we may have trouble reading your answers.\nlooking ahead to next week, there will be a tutorial on Monday for which there will be a worksheet (on the material from last week), and there will be lectures on Tuesday and Thursday on new material. This lecture material will not be on the midterm, but you can count on it being on the final exam, and it will help you understand what follows in the course.\n\n2024-02-20 13:40 (edit 14:05): ok, so there is a Tuesday update instead:\n\nAssignments 3 and 4 are graded, and I will post the marks in a moment. Appeals by the usual procedure, between Feb 23 and Mar 1 (for both). There was some work that was rather obviously AI-generated; I will decide whether I want to pursue academic integrity violations on any of it. A reminder that the sorts of things I ask you to do yourself on assignments are the same sorts of things you will need to do yourself on the exams, so by using anything other than your own brain and the course materials on the assignments, you are setting yourself up for failure on the exams.\nAssignment 3 appears to be graded; I will post the marks once I have confirmation from the grader. (edit: it has been graded.)\nCoverage for the midterm is what we did in lecture before reading week, up to and including the “cliffhanger” (that is to say, the matched pairs \\(t\\)-test).\n\n2024-02-18 22:15: A Sunday night “Monday update” to remind you that this upcoming week is Reading Week, so there are no tutorials tomorrow or lectures on Tuesday or Thursday. We resume on the 26th.\n2024-02-15 13:30: in what seems like a repeat of previous announcements, it is snowing, but I am here and campus is open, so class goes ahead. Today, normal quantile plots and however much of matched pairs we get to.\n2024-02-14 13:30: My solutions to Assignment 4.\n2024-02-12 10:50: Monday update:\n\ntutorials today; the worksheet.\nassignments:\n\nAssignment 2 is graded; I will release the marks shortly. Appeals by the same procedure as Assignment 1 between Feb 15 and Feb 22.\nAssignment 3 is almost graded.\nAssignment 4 was due last night. Reminders: the late penalty is 1% per hour; if you are a few minutes late, you will lose 1%, and it is not worth your time or mine to quibble about that. Also, a complete submission is the rendered version of your Quarto document; if your document does not render, it is up to you to find out why and to fix it.\nAssignment 5 opens tonight. You have two weeks to do this one (it is due on Sunday night at the end of reading week).\n\nlectures: I think I am done with power of hypothesis tests. There are some more examples in the lecture notes, which you can read if you want to gain some extra understanding.\n\nTuesday: sign test\nThursday: normal quantile plot, matched pairs\n\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 8 (power and sample size), 9 (sign test), 11 (matched pairs), 12 (normal quantile plots).\n\n2024-02-08 12:00: Worksheet 5 for Monday’s tutorial.\n2024-02-08 10:50: my solutions to Assignment 3.\n2024-02-06 11:30: On assignment 4, question 2, I was a little bit eager on the delete key! I just put back the actual question and the link to the data file, so that you now know what you were supposed to be doing. Re-download the questions from Quercus if you need to.\n2024-02-05 15:15: assignment planning: there will be no assignments due during reading week or the weekend of the midterm. That means you’ll get two weeks to do each of Assignment 5 (due the Sunday night at the end of reading week) and Assignment 6 (due March 10). The eighth and final assignment will be due on March 24, so you’ll get a break at the end of the course.\n2024-02-05 11:45: Monday update:\n\nTutorials happening today as usual; see the note three days ago for the worksheet.\nAssignments: there will be a delay in marking assignment #2 (which is my fault), but I now have graders for #2 and #3. #3 was due yesterday, but remains open until Tuesday with late penalty. #4 opens tonight.\nLectures:\n\nTuesday: the rest of the bootstrap stuff, including the code that we skipped last week.\nThursday: power of hypothesis tests. In with both of those is a procedure for how you might do simulations in general. My take is that statistical theory will only take you so far; you will run into places where the math is beyond you and simulation is the only way to understand what is happening.\n\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 8 for power. For examples of bootstrap distribution of sample mean, look in the Extras to the problems in chapters 6 and 7.\n\n2024-02-02 12:45: Worksheet 4, for tutorial on Monday.\n2024-02-01 10:30: My solutions to Assignment 2.\n2024-01-30 13:45: I was sure I had posted my solutions to assignment 1, but they seemed to have disappeared. Click the link just above to see them.\n2024-01-29 13:15: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 1 has been graded (see below for appeal procedure)\nAssignment 2 was due last night and is open (with late penalty) until Tuesday night\nAssignment 3 opens tonight, and is due next Sunday night.\nTutorials are happening today as usual; you’ll be working on worksheet 3.\nIn lectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of one-sample inference\nThursday: two-sample inference (which is a bit more complicated than you learned in B57). I might get into the bootstrap sampling distribution of the sample mean this week, or it might be next week.\n\nPractice problems for this week’s material: chapters 6 and 7 of PASIAS.\n\n2024-01-29 11:00: Assignment 1 has been graded, and I am about to post the marks.\n\nIf you wish to appeal your mark, first read sections 3.19 through 3.23 of the detailed course policies. For your appeal to be successful, you will need to demonstrate an error in the grading: that is to say, you will need to demonstrate that your work was actually correct despite not receiving full marks. Read carefully the last sentence of 3.19 as well as the whole of 3.20 in the detailed course policies. You are also warned that I have the right to regrade your entire assignment, and so your mark can go down as well as up.\nTo appeal your mark on an assignment, write me an email with the word “appeal”, the course code, and the assignment number in the subject line, for assignment 1 between February 2 and February 9 inclusive, in which you explain how there was an error in the grading of your assignment: that is to say, the grader missed something you wrote that was completely correct according to my solutions or that you argue also was a complete answer to the question. This also includes such things as addition errors in your assignment mark.\n\n2024-01-26 12:00: Worksheet 3 for tutorial on Monday. (Edit 2024-01-27 20:20: thanks to the eagle eyes of one of your TAs, a typo has been corrected.)\n2024-01-24 23:30: if you seem to be unable to create new Quarto documents, this is probably because you are running an old version of R Studio on your own computer. You can check what version you are currently running by selecting Help and About R Studio. Mine is 2023.12.0. Versions 2022.07.1 and newer include Quarto in them (including the ability to create new Quarto documents). If yours is older than that, now is a good time to upgrade.\n2024-01-24 11:25: We have a midterm date. See the announcement on Quercus for date, time, and place.\n2024-01-23 11:30: hint for one of the parts of Assignment 2: geom_line joins neighbouring points on a graph with a line.\n2024-01-22 13:40: this week:\n\nAssignment 1 was due last night, and remains open until Tuesday with late penalty.\ntutorial today, to work through Worksheet 2.\nAssignment 2, on the same material as worksheet 2, opens tonight and is due next Sunday night.\nin lectures this week:\n\nChoosing things from dataframes (this is a lot, but it goes fast)\nthe first part of statistical inference.\n\nMore practice problems: chapters 1 through about 6 of PASIAS.\n\n2024-01-18 22:00: I just took a look through the assignment 0’s that were handed in:\n\nIf you seemed to have done the right thing and I could see it including your graph, you should have 1 mark (out of 1). If you handed something in and for some reason it didn’t work, you’ll have a mark of zero plus a comment. Mostly this was that I couldn’t see your graph. If that happened to you, figure out how to fix it before you hand in assignment 1. (Hint: did you include the “embed-resources” thing described in 2(j) on Worksheet 1? If you had re-downloaded the file you handed in, you would have been able to see that your graph did not make it.)\nYou can have as many attempts at Assignment 0 as you wish. If you didn’t get it the first time, I encourage you to have another go. I intend to take a look in the next day or two at any more that are handed in since I looked just now.\nMy past experience is that most of the people who have trouble handing in Assignment 1 properly did not even attempt assignment 0. You have a free chance here to make sure that you understand the procedure.\n\n2024-01-18 15:30:\n\nWorksheet 2, on this week’s material, for tutorial on Monday.\nThe waitlist for this course is now closed. The course is full, so I will not enrol any extra people in the class (and bear in mind that everyone on the waitlist wanted to get into the course, so your reasons for getting in are not special). If you didn’t make it this year, you are welcome to try again next year, but be aware that you will need to register as early as possible. I try to save some places for 4th years (by UTSC’s definition: 14 or more credits).\n\n2024-01-15 11:00: On the agenda this week:\n\nAssignment 1, on the stuff you are doing on the worksheet today, will open tonight and be due next Sunday night (the 21st).\nLectures:\n\nmaking graphs (Tuesday)\nnumerical summaries, choosing things from dataframes (start) (Thursday)\n\nnext week’s tutorial (on Monday, a week from today) will feature a worksheet on the things in this week’s lectures.\nAssignment 2 (opening Monday next week) will also be on those things.\n\n2024-01-15 09:30: reminder: your tutorial is today, for practice on Worksheet 1 and handing in “Assignment 0” (the first “real assignment” will be due next week).\n2024-01-11 15:15:\n\nWorksheet 1, for practice on this week’s material.\nThe two datafiles I forgot earlier: coffee.txt, migraine.txt. You should be able to find course datafiles at a URL like http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/filename.txt where you replace filename.txt by whatever the file is called.\n\n2024-01-11 11:45: looking out of my office window, I might as well repeat Tuesday’s announcement!\n\nafter today’s lecture, I will post Worksheet 1, which gives you a chance to work through some of the stuff we’ve seen so far. You can work through it during tutorial, or before (and bring any problems or confusions to tutorial).\nAssignment 1 will open after Monday’s tutorial, and will be due the following Sunday night (Jan 21). Expect the same structure each week: working through the worksheet, with help available in tutorial, will prepare you for the next assignment, and doing the assignments (yourself!) will prepare you for the exams.\nData files for today’s lecture: test1.xls, test1.csv, test2.xls\n\n2024-01-09 10:40: campus is open, I am here, and the weather looks worse than it actually is, so class goes ahead today. On the agenda for this week:\n\ntoday: course outline and running R\nThursday: reading data from files.\n\n2024-01-08 12:25: first lecture is tomorrow; your ACORN has the location. Here is a short description of how things will go:\n\nTwo one-hour lectures a week, Tuesday and Thursday. I will have office hours after each lecture, or you can talk with me at the end of lecture, or you can post in the Quercus discussions for the course.\nYou should be registered in one of the three tutorials (on Mondays, starting next week, in week 2 of classes).\nIn tutorial, you will get a worksheet to work through yourself (with my answers and extra discussion). There will be at least one TA in attendance. Ask for help if you get stuck or confused.\nThere will be weekly assignments, with the first one opening on January 15 after tutorial (and due the following Sunday night). There will be about eight assignments altogether, with no assignments due during reading week or around the midterm.\nEach item helps you with the next on the list: doing the worksheet will help you with the corresponding assignment, and doing the assignments will help you with the exams.\nThe first part of the lecture notes contains the course outline. Read this now, to get a more detailed idea of what to expect.\n\n2024-01-03 11:10: lecture 1 is just under a week away. I am assuming that you are completely familiar with basic statistical techniques, such as:\n\nwhat graphs are available to you for each kind of data, and how to interpret them\nwhat a hypothesis test does and does not do\ntests for one and two and more than two means (\\(t\\)-tests for the first two and ANOVA for the third)\nhow to apply all of these to data and to interpret the results\nbasic probability distributions\nwe will learn how to do all of the above in R (I assume you know nothing about R).\n\nThere is very little actual math in this course, but there are a lot of ideas, and there is a lot of explanation of those ideas as they apply to data. Thus, you need to understand the theory that you have learned, but you also need to know how it applies to the data in front of you.\nIf you have learned some R before, you may see that I do things differently from what you learned before. I am expecting you to do things in this course as I teach them. All the work in this course can be done using ideas from this course, except where I say otherwise.\n2023-12-14 14:05: I found room for a few more students, 4th years in either our Major or Specialist programs. I know there are not very many C or D level courses in the winter semester, so these seemed to be the people whose need was greatest.\n2023-12-12 16:30: I’ve been doing some planning for this course. Here’s what to expect:\n\nlectures Tuesday and Thursday (1 hour each)\ntutorial Monday, in a computer lab, in which you will get a worksheet to work through on the material from the previous week’s lecture, with a TA or two around to help if you get stuck or confused. Tutorials start in week 2.\nweekly assignments open on Monday night, on the same material as the worksheet you just did, and are due the following Sunday night. The first assignment will open in week 2.\nthere will be about 8 assignments.\na midterm (2 hours) and a final exam (3 hours) as usual, on dates to be announced. I will move any assignments with due dates close to the midterm, as needed. My exams are always open book.\nthe worksheets will help you with the assignments, and the assignments will help you with the exams, provided you do them yourself.\n\n2023-08-10 13:30: I have asked to add some students to the course. These are all UTSC students, 4th years who joined the waitlist before August 9, and 3rd years who joined the waitlist before 10:30am on July 11. If you are still on the waitlist after this has been processed, you will have to take your chances.\n\n2024-03-15 12:45:\n\nWorksheet 8 for tutorial on Monday. This will prepare you for Assignment 8, which opens on Monday night.\nAssignment 8 is the last assignment, but I will make worksheets the rest of the way, and there will be tutorials on the remaining Mondays. This is to help you get prepared for the final exam, which will definitely include some things that didn’t make it onto assignments (examples: the regression stuff we do next week, writing functions, Bayesian analysis, and anything else we get to).\n\n2024-03-13 11:20: my solutions to assignment 6.\n2024-03-12 11:00: Power went out here (on campus) for a few minutes, but is now back, whether from actual hydro or from a generator, I don’t know. So class goes ahead, as far as I know.\n2024-03-11 11:00: Monday update:\n\nThe midterm is marked. Stats: Q1 51.25 (76%), median 56 (83%), Q3 60 (89%). I will be sharing the marks and the marked midterms shortly. The marks will be on Quercus, and you will be receiving an email from Crowdmark with instructions to see your marked exam.\n\nAppeals are the same procedure as for assignments, between Mar 14 and Mar 21 inclusive. Do not expect me to overrule the grader’s judgment; thus, the only thing worth appealing is an actual grading error, such as an answer where the grader didn’t mark something relevant that you wrote, after consideration of my solutions and any comments on your exam. If you have not received full marks on a question part, you should have received a comment on your exam, or it should be obvious from my solutions what is missing or in error, or both of those things. Your appeal must include a clear description of the grading error (not grading judgment). If you appeal a grading judgment, you run the risk that I regrade your whole exam and your mark may go down as well as up. My philosophy on appeals is similar to that of Jeff Rosenthal.\n\nTutorials are happening today; worksheet 7. If you run out of time, as you probably will, you can leave the last question (the home prices data) until next week.\nAssignment 6 was due last night. A reminder that there are no extensions, as stated in the course outline; you have the option of handing the assignment in before Tuesday night and taking the late penalty, or of counting it as one of your two worst assignments (or both). It is up to you to manage your time.\nAssignment 7 opens tonight.\nLectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of tidying data (there are two other small sections of notes, “tidying extras” and “when pivot-wider goes wrong”).\nThursday: the first case study, on simple regression.\n\n\n2024-03-09 21:30: the end is in sight: the midterm is now 90% marked. I had a totally thrilling day getting the marking done that I assigned to myself on this exam, and I am now done. I’m not sure I shared my solutions, which are updated with extra comments on the bits that I marked.\n2024-03-08 21:15: two updates:\n\nthe midterm is now 62% marked. I spent today working on my other midterm, but tomorrow I plan to get to my marking on this one. The TAs are most of the way through their shares of the marking.\nthere is tutorial on Monday, in which you’ll be working on this worksheet, which will prepare you for Assignment 7 (that opens on Monday night).\n\n2024-03-07 22:15: a little bit of progress today: we are now at 33% done. I have been focusing on my other midterm, which I gave myself more of to mark.\n2024-03-06 23:00: the midterms are scanned and marking is underway. We are at 29% done.\n2024-03-05 13:30: the blog post about Tukey’s method that I mentioned in lecture, if you want more background.\n2024-03-04 11:00: Monday update:\n\nthere is no TA strike. Last night, the university and the TA union came to a “tentative agreement”, which the TAs still have to vote on (so we are not safe yet), but for now there is no strike.\non the midterm, questions 2(f) and 2(g) were impossible to answer with the information I gave you, so I have removed them from the exam (which is now out of 67 points).\nexam marking will begin once the exams have been scanned and uploaded to Crowdmark.\nreminder that there are no tutorials today. If you have not yet worked through worksheet 6, now would be a good time to do so, in preparation for Assignment 6 (which is due next Sunday night).\nlectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of analysis of variance\nThursday: tidying data\n\nextra practice problems in PASIAS: chapter 13 (analysis of variance), chapter 17 (tidying data). The intervening chapters are on writing reports, on which there is lecture material, but I won’t be talking about that this time.\n\n2024-03-01 12:20:\n\nmy solutions to Assignment 5\nif you have to miss the midterm, the weight goes automatically onto the final exam. Complete an absence declaration so that there is a record. (added 2024-03-03 20:30: if you already used your absence declaration, I do not need to see any additional documentation, but any other professors affected by your absence might, so be prepared.)\nconversely, if your final exam is better than your midterm, the final exam counts instead of your midterm.\nthere will be no tutorials on Monday (regardless of whether the TAs are on strike) because if the TAs are working, they will be marking your midterm.\n\n2024-02-26 11:35: Monday update:\n\nMidterm time and location is on an announcement on Quercus labelled Midterm. See the notes from Feb 20 and 22 for course coverage and exam procedures.\nAssignment 5 was due last night. Assignment 6 opens tonight; you have two weeks to complete this (so that it is not due the same weekend as the midterm), but the material on it is on the midterm, so you would do well to work on it as part of your preparation.\nTutorial today, where you have the chance to ask subject-matter questions of your TAs as well as work on worksheet 6, which will prepare you for Assignment 6, which will help you prepare for the midterm.\nSee the Feb 20 note for what is on the midterm.\nLectures this week:\n\nTuesday: matched pairs sign test, Mood median test\nThursday: analysis of variance\n\nExtra practice problems in PASIAS (the chapters get out of order here):\n\nChapter 12: normal quantile plots\nChapter 11: matched pairs\nChapter 10: Mood’s median test\nChapter 13: analysis of variance.\n\nif you have questions as you prepare for the midterm, post them on the Quercus discussion board or catch me after lecture.\n\n2024-02-22 21:00: one more thing today: Worksheet 6, for tutorial on Monday. If you have subject-matter questions about the material on the exam, you can also ask your TA about those on Monday. If you have administrative questions about the exam that are not answered elsewhere, put them on the Quercus discussion board.\n2024-02-22 12:05:\n\nthe midterm is open-book. You can bring what you wish, such as your lecture notes, assignments, my slides, assignment solutions, etc, printed (no computers or other devices at the exam). You will need to organize whatever you bring, so that you can quickly find what you are looking for (and so there is an upper limit on what there is any point in bringing). If you are not well prepared, you can expect to run out of time; you will not have time to look everything up or go searching for things.\nthe exam is on its way to be printed. There are 6 questions, with a total of 30 parts worth 73 points altogether (the parts are typically worth 2 or 3 points and are about as much work as you would do on an assignment for 2 or 3 points). Expect to be writing code and explanations (for example, I might ask for code to do a task, or give you code or output and ask questions about it).\nat the exam, you will of course get an exam paper with spaces to write your answers, but you also get a booklet with numbered Figures to refer to during the exam. The exam will say things like “In Figure 10, what is…” and you will need to find Figure 10 in the other booklet.\nthis is a Crowdmark exam, so it is best to use a pen or a sharp pencil, otherwise we may have trouble reading your answers.\nlooking ahead to next week, there will be a tutorial on Monday for which there will be a worksheet (on the material from last week), and there will be lectures on Tuesday and Thursday on new material. This lecture material will not be on the midterm, but you can count on it being on the final exam, and it will help you understand what follows in the course.\n\n2024-02-20 13:40 (edit 14:05): ok, so there is a Tuesday update instead:\n\nAssignments 3 and 4 are graded, and I will post the marks in a moment. Appeals by the usual procedure, between Feb 23 and Mar 1 (for both). There was some work that was rather obviously AI-generated; I will decide whether I want to pursue academic integrity violations on any of it. A reminder that the sorts of things I ask you to do yourself on assignments are the same sorts of things you will need to do yourself on the exams, so by using anything other than your own brain and the course materials on the assignments, you are setting yourself up for failure on the exams.\nAssignment 3 appears to be graded; I will post the marks once I have confirmation from the grader. (edit: it has been graded.)\nCoverage for the midterm is what we did in lecture before reading week, up to and including the “cliffhanger” (that is to say, the matched pairs \\(t\\)-test).\n\n2024-02-18 22:15: A Sunday night “Monday update” to remind you that this upcoming week is Reading Week, so there are no tutorials tomorrow or lectures on Tuesday or Thursday. We resume on the 26th.\n2024-02-15 13:30: in what seems like a repeat of previous announcements, it is snowing, but I am here and campus is open, so class goes ahead. Today, normal quantile plots and however much of matched pairs we get to.\n2024-02-14 13:30: My solutions to Assignment 4.\n2024-02-12 10:50: Monday update:\n\ntutorials today; the worksheet.\nassignments:\n\nAssignment 2 is graded; I will release the marks shortly. Appeals by the same procedure as Assignment 1 between Feb 15 and Feb 22.\nAssignment 3 is almost graded.\nAssignment 4 was due last night. Reminders: the late penalty is 1% per hour; if you are a few minutes late, you will lose 1%, and it is not worth your time or mine to quibble about that. Also, a complete submission is the rendered version of your Quarto document; if your document does not render, it is up to you to find out why and to fix it.\nAssignment 5 opens tonight. You have two weeks to do this one (it is due on Sunday night at the end of reading week).\n\nlectures: I think I am done with power of hypothesis tests. There are some more examples in the lecture notes, which you can read if you want to gain some extra understanding.\n\nTuesday: sign test\nThursday: normal quantile plot, matched pairs\n\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 8 (power and sample size), 9 (sign test), 11 (matched pairs), 12 (normal quantile plots).\n\n2024-02-08 12:00: Worksheet 5 for Monday’s tutorial.\n2024-02-08 10:50: my solutions to Assignment 3.\n2024-02-06 11:30: On assignment 4, question 2, I was a little bit eager on the delete key! I just put back the actual question and the link to the data file, so that you now know what you were supposed to be doing. Re-download the questions from Quercus if you need to.\n2024-02-05 15:15: assignment planning: there will be no assignments due during reading week or the weekend of the midterm. That means you’ll get two weeks to do each of Assignment 5 (due the Sunday night at the end of reading week) and Assignment 6 (due March 10). The eighth and final assignment will be due on March 24, so you’ll get a break at the end of the course.\n2024-02-05 11:45: Monday update:\n\nTutorials happening today as usual; see the note three days ago for the worksheet.\nAssignments: there will be a delay in marking assignment #2 (which is my fault), but I now have graders for #2 and #3. #3 was due yesterday, but remains open until Tuesday with late penalty. #4 opens tonight.\nLectures:\n\nTuesday: the rest of the bootstrap stuff, including the code that we skipped last week.\nThursday: power of hypothesis tests. In with both of those is a procedure for how you might do simulations in general. My take is that statistical theory will only take you so far; you will run into places where the math is beyond you and simulation is the only way to understand what is happening.\n\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 8 for power. For examples of bootstrap distribution of sample mean, look in the Extras to the problems in chapters 6 and 7.\n\n2024-02-02 12:45: Worksheet 4, for tutorial on Monday.\n2024-02-01 10:30: My solutions to Assignment 2.\n2024-01-30 13:45: I was sure I had posted my solutions to assignment 1, but they seemed to have disappeared. Click the link just above to see them.\n2024-01-29 13:15: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 1 has been graded (see below for appeal procedure)\nAssignment 2 was due last night and is open (with late penalty) until Tuesday night\nAssignment 3 opens tonight, and is due next Sunday night.\nTutorials are happening today as usual; you’ll be working on worksheet 3.\nIn lectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of one-sample inference\nThursday: two-sample inference (which is a bit more complicated than you learned in B57). I might get into the bootstrap sampling distribution of the sample mean this week, or it might be next week.\n\nPractice problems for this week’s material: chapters 6 and 7 of PASIAS.\n\n2024-01-29 11:00: Assignment 1 has been graded, and I am about to post the marks.\n\nIf you wish to appeal your mark, first read sections 3.19 through 3.23 of the detailed course policies. For your appeal to be successful, you will need to demonstrate an error in the grading: that is to say, you will need to demonstrate that your work was actually correct despite not receiving full marks. Read carefully the last sentence of 3.19 as well as the whole of 3.20 in the detailed course policies. You are also warned that I have the right to regrade your entire assignment, and so your mark can go down as well as up.\nTo appeal your mark on an assignment, write me an email with the word “appeal”, the course code, and the assignment number in the subject line, for assignment 1 between February 2 and February 9 inclusive, in which you explain how there was an error in the grading of your assignment: that is to say, the grader missed something you wrote that was completely correct according to my solutions or that you argue also was a complete answer to the question. This also includes such things as addition errors in your assignment mark.\n\n2024-01-26 12:00: Worksheet 3 for tutorial on Monday. (Edit 2024-01-27 20:20: thanks to the eagle eyes of one of your TAs, a typo has been corrected.)\n2024-01-24 23:30: if you seem to be unable to create new Quarto documents, this is probably because you are running an old version of R Studio on your own computer. You can check what version you are currently running by selecting Help and About R Studio. Mine is 2023.12.0. Versions 2022.07.1 and newer include Quarto in them (including the ability to create new Quarto documents). If yours is older than that, now is a good time to upgrade.\n2024-01-24 11:25: We have a midterm date. See the announcement on Quercus for date, time, and place.\n2024-01-23 11:30: hint for one of the parts of Assignment 2: geom_line joins neighbouring points on a graph with a line.\n2024-01-22 13:40: this week:\n\nAssignment 1 was due last night, and remains open until Tuesday with late penalty.\ntutorial today, to work through Worksheet 2.\nAssignment 2, on the same material as worksheet 2, opens tonight and is due next Sunday night.\nin lectures this week:\n\nChoosing things from dataframes (this is a lot, but it goes fast)\nthe first part of statistical inference.\n\nMore practice problems: chapters 1 through about 6 of PASIAS.\n\n2024-01-18 22:00: I just took a look through the assignment 0’s that were handed in:\n\nIf you seemed to have done the right thing and I could see it including your graph, you should have 1 mark (out of 1). If you handed something in and for some reason it didn’t work, you’ll have a mark of zero plus a comment. Mostly this was that I couldn’t see your graph. If that happened to you, figure out how to fix it before you hand in assignment 1. (Hint: did you include the “embed-resources” thing described in 2(j) on Worksheet 1? If you had re-downloaded the file you handed in, you would have been able to see that your graph did not make it.)\nYou can have as many attempts at Assignment 0 as you wish. If you didn’t get it the first time, I encourage you to have another go. I intend to take a look in the next day or two at any more that are handed in since I looked just now.\nMy past experience is that most of the people who have trouble handing in Assignment 1 properly did not even attempt assignment 0. You have a free chance here to make sure that you understand the procedure.\n\n2024-01-18 15:30:\n\nWorksheet 2, on this week’s material, for tutorial on Monday.\nThe waitlist for this course is now closed. The course is full, so I will not enrol any extra people in the class (and bear in mind that everyone on the waitlist wanted to get into the course, so your reasons for getting in are not special). If you didn’t make it this year, you are welcome to try again next year, but be aware that you will need to register as early as possible. I try to save some places for 4th years (by UTSC’s definition: 14 or more credits).\n\n2024-01-15 11:00: On the agenda this week:\n\nAssignment 1, on the stuff you are doing on the worksheet today, will open tonight and be due next Sunday night (the 21st).\nLectures:\n\nmaking graphs (Tuesday)\nnumerical summaries, choosing things from dataframes (start) (Thursday)\n\nnext week’s tutorial (on Monday, a week from today) will feature a worksheet on the things in this week’s lectures.\nAssignment 2 (opening Monday next week) will also be on those things.\n\n2024-01-15 09:30: reminder: your tutorial is today, for practice on Worksheet 1 and handing in “Assignment 0” (the first “real assignment” will be due next week).\n2024-01-11 15:15:\n\nWorksheet 1, for practice on this week’s material.\nThe two datafiles I forgot earlier: coffee.txt, migraine.txt. You should be able to find course datafiles at a URL like http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/filename.txt where you replace filename.txt by whatever the file is called.\n\n2024-01-11 11:45: looking out of my office window, I might as well repeat Tuesday’s announcement!\n\nafter today’s lecture, I will post Worksheet 1, which gives you a chance to work through some of the stuff we’ve seen so far. You can work through it during tutorial, or before (and bring any problems or confusions to tutorial).\nAssignment 1 will open after Monday’s tutorial, and will be due the following Sunday night (Jan 21). Expect the same structure each week: working through the worksheet, with help available in tutorial, will prepare you for the next assignment, and doing the assignments (yourself!) will prepare you for the exams.\nData files for today’s lecture: test1.xls, test1.csv, test2.xls\n\n2024-01-09 10:40: campus is open, I am here, and the weather looks worse than it actually is, so class goes ahead today. On the agenda for this week:\n\ntoday: course outline and running R\nThursday: reading data from files.\n\n2024-01-08 12:25: first lecture is tomorrow; your ACORN has the location. Here is a short description of how things will go:\n\nTwo one-hour lectures a week, Tuesday and Thursday. I will have office hours after each lecture, or you can talk with me at the end of lecture, or you can post in the Quercus discussions for the course.\nYou should be registered in one of the three tutorials (on Mondays, starting next week, in week 2 of classes).\nIn tutorial, you will get a worksheet to work through yourself (with my answers and extra discussion). There will be at least one TA in attendance. Ask for help if you get stuck or confused.\nThere will be weekly assignments, with the first one opening on January 15 after tutorial (and due the following Sunday night). There will be about eight assignments altogether, with no assignments due during reading week or around the midterm.\nEach item helps you with the next on the list: doing the worksheet will help you with the corresponding assignment, and doing the assignments will help you with the exams.\nThe first part of the lecture notes contains the course outline. Read this now, to get a more detailed idea of what to expect.\n\n2024-01-03 11:10: lecture 1 is just under a week away. I am assuming that you are completely familiar with basic statistical techniques, such as:\n\nwhat graphs are available to you for each kind of data, and how to interpret them\nwhat a hypothesis test does and does not do\ntests for one and two and more than two means (\\(t\\)-tests for the first two and ANOVA for the third)\nhow to apply all of these to data and to interpret the results\nbasic probability distributions\nwe will learn how to do all of the above in R (I assume you know nothing about R).\n\nThere is very little actual math in this course, but there are a lot of ideas, and there is a lot of explanation of those ideas as they apply to data. Thus, you need to understand the theory that you have learned, but you also need to know how it applies to the data in front of you.\nIf you have learned some R before, you may see that I do things differently from what you learned before. I am expecting you to do things in this course as I teach them. All the work in this course can be done using ideas from this course, except where I say otherwise.\n2023-12-14 14:05: I found room for a few more students, 4th years in either our Major or Specialist programs. I know there are not very many C or D level courses in the winter semester, so these seemed to be the people whose need was greatest.\n2023-12-12 16:30: I’ve been doing some planning for this course. Here’s what to expect:\n\nlectures Tuesday and Thursday (1 hour each)\ntutorial Monday, in a computer lab, in which you will get a worksheet to work through on the material from the previous week’s lecture, with a TA or two around to help if you get stuck or confused. Tutorials start in week 2.\nweekly assignments open on Monday night, on the same material as the worksheet you just did, and are due the following Sunday night. The first assignment will open in week 2.\nthere will be about 8 assignments.\na midterm (2 hours) and a final exam (3 hours) as usual, on dates to be announced. I will move any assignments with due dates close to the midterm, as needed. My exams are always open book.\nthe worksheets will help you with the assignments, and the assignments will help you with the exams, provided you do them yourself.\n\n2023-08-10 13:30: I have asked to add some students to the course. These are all UTSC students, 4th years who joined the waitlist before August 9, and 3rd years who joined the waitlist before 10:30am on July 11. If you are still on the waitlist after this has been processed, you will have to take your chances.\n2023-08-10 12:50: I am aware that the course has a longish waitlist. I have room to add a few more students. I will be prioritizing 4th years, since I know that majors/minors/specialists require a certain number of upper-level courses to complete their programs. If there is room to admit 3rd years, I will do so in the order that they joined the waitlist. This is (historically) a popular class, and it is up to you to register for it as early as possible if you want to get in. Do not appeal to me for special treatment. The choice of students to add is mine."

    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions about the Applied Statistics Minor program",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Applied Statistics Minor and Statistics Minor are two very different programs, intended for students with different preparations:\n\nthe Applied Statistics Minor is for students who have taken STAB22 and STAB27 (or an equivalent pair of courses such as PSYB07 & PSYC08, or MGEB11 & MGEB12), with a relatively limited mathematical background. The program is based on a conceptual and computational (with software) approach to the subject matter, and you will be expected to explain and justify your answers.\nthe Statistics Minor is for students who have taken STAB52 and STAB57 and who thus have a background in calculus. This program is based on mainly theoretical understanding of statistical methods, but a student who completes this program should be able to develop the practical skills needed in the real world.\n\nThe choice between programs therefore depends on which introductory Statistics courses you took.\nIf you try to take the “wrong” program based on your preparation, you will run into a lot of problems with course exclusions. This is especially true if you try to take the Applied Minor when you should be taking the Minor. A consequence of this is that you may end up with too few distinct credits to graduate. (Excluded courses, ones marked Extra on your transcript and in Degree Explorer, do not count as distinct credits.)\nSpecific questions you might have are listed below.\n\nHow long does it take? Two academic years. Suggested timetable:\n\n\nacademic year 1 fall: STAB22 or equivalent, CSCA20\nyear 1 winter: STAB27 or equivalent (PSYC08 and MGEB12 are sometimes offered in the summer)\nyear 2 fall: STAC32, STAC53\nyear 2 winter: STAD29\nas offered: your courses for the last requirement.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between STAB22, STAB23, PSYB07, and MGEB11? These are all first Statistics courses aimed at students with relatively little mathematics. PSYB07 and MGEB11 are intended for students in psychology and economics for management respectively. STAB23 is intended for students in the social sciences. STAB22 is for everybody else. I only recommend taking PSYB07, MGEB11, or STAB23 if you are in one of the programs that uses those courses specifically; you will find that those courses use examples from psychology, economics and the social sciences (respectively), and so if you are studying something else, you will find the course material confusing, and you do better to take the more general STAB22 (whose examples are from a variety of fields).\nWhich second Statistics course should I take? Take the one that matches the first course you took: if you took PSYB07, take PSYC08; if you took MGEB11, take MGEB12; if you took STAB22 or STAB23, take STAB27. You may be able to take mis-matching courses, but if you do, you may find that material you need in your second course includes things you did not do in your first course.\nMy Degree Explorer says that I need STAC50, which I cannot get into, but the program requirements say STAC53. What should I do? You should take STAC53, and you should also email me with your student number so that I can change your Degree Explorer for you.\nCan I take STAB27 and STAC32 out of order to complete the program quicker? No. Prerequisites are enforced and you will be removed from STAC32 if you enrol. The same applies if you try to take STAD29 without having taken STAC32. Read the prerequisites carefully. The program is designed to take two academic years to complete. See question 0.\nCan I substitute other courses for STAC32, STAC53, STAD29? You can take STA 304 in place of STAC53, but otherwise no. If you want to use STA 304, you need to email me so that I can update your Degree Explorer. You should also be aware that STA 304 has a prerequisite STA 255, which itself requires a calculus course (which could be MATA33).\nI’m having trouble finding courses for requirement 5. Can I substitute something else? Maybe. The point of requirement 5 is that the two courses should have a significant quantitative component, for example actual math courses (such as calculus), actual other STA courses (STAC51 is your best bet), or a course in or near your discipline that has a significant quantitative component. PSYC09 and GGRC42 are examples of other courses I would accept. If you wish me to consider another course beyond the ones listed in the Calendar or on your Degree Explorer, email me, if necessary making your case that the course in question has a significant quantitative compenent.\nCan I take a Statistics Specialist/Major/Minor and an Applied Statistics Minor? No.\nCan I use STAB52 and/or STAB57 to satisfy any requirements for the Applied Statistics Minor? No. You should be taking the Statistics Minor instead.\nI have taken MATA32 and MAT33, and also MGEB11 and MGEB12. Can I take the Applied Statistics Minor? Yes.\nI have taken, or plan to take, MATA30/A31 and MATA36/37. Should I take the Applied Statistics Minor? No. The Statistics Minor is a better fit for you.\nI have taken other first-year calculus courses, such as MATA29. Can I take the Applied Statistics Minor? If you want. You will need to take STAB22 (or equivalent) and STAB27 (or equivalent).\nI am taking a Computer Science Minor. Can I also take the Applied Statistics Minor? Yes.\nI am in Statistics Specialist, Major, Minor, or the Math Specialist, Statistics Stream. Can I also take the Applied Statistics Minor, or any of STAC32, STAC53, STAD29 for credit? No and no.\nI have questions about the Statistics Minor. Can I ask you? No. Email the Supervisor of Studies for that program.\nI want to learn some SAS. Will I be learning that in any of your courses? No, not as they are currently arranged, but you might find this site useful. You will probably recognize the data sets used there, if you have taken any of my courses."

    "text": "My exams come with a booklet of questions (with space to write your answers). In the exam, there are references to Figures which are in a separate booklet (in the column Figures below). Print that out, or otherwise have it available as you work through each exam.\nHere are old midterm and final exams going back to 2015. You will notice that the best way of doing things has changed over time. Be guided by how things are done now rather than in the past.\nI now teach R only in my courses. 2018 was the first year that I started with R and finished with SAS. Before that, I did R and SAS both for each statistical technique. Thus, for example, you will see some SAS in old midterms, which you won’t see now. Make allowances for this.\nOne of the most effective ways to find out whether you know something is to answer questions on it. (Another way is to explain it to someone else.) Thus, your best use of these exams is to do them under exam conditions without looking at the solutions, and then look at the solutions and grade yourself. This is the fastest way to find out what you don’t understand. Read through your notes and work through examples on what you missed, then tackle another exam.\nI would recommend starting with last year’s exams (the most similar to the exams you’ll see) and working backwards.\nIf all you do is read through the solutions, you have wasted a huge learning opportunity, because you will not be prepared to deal with what you face on exam day."

My priority order is: students in the Statistics Applied Minor program, and within those, students in the fourth year of study (or beyond) as calculated by UTSC, then students in earlier years of study in the program, and then students in other programs.

They are not a substitute for routinely missing lecture; if you do that, you risk missing important material and thereby hurting your grade.\nI will be checking prerequisites. To take STAC32, you must have completed (by the time STAC32 starts in September) either STAB27 or PSYC08 or MGEB12. If you have not completed one of these courses by then, you will be removed from STAC32.\nLooking ahead to next winter’s STAD29: my aim is to make sure that there will be enough space in that course for everyone that wants to take it (and has completed STAC32).\nProgram FAQ."
