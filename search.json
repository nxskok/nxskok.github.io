    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions about the Applied Statistics Minor program",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Applied Statistics Minor and Statistics Minor are two very different programs, intended for students with different preparations:\n\nthe Applied Statistics Minor is for students who have taken STAB22 and STAB27 (or an equivalent pair of courses such as PSYB07 & PSYC08, or MGEB11 & MGEB12), with a relatively limited mathematical background. The program is based on a conceptual and computational (with software) approach to the subject matter, and you will be expected to explain and justify your answers.\nthe Statistics Minor is for students who have taken STAB52 and STAB57 and who thus have a background in calculus. This program is based on mainly theoretical understanding of statistical methods, but a student who completes this program should be able to develop the practical skills needed in the real world.\n\nThe choice between programs therefore depends on which introductory Statistics courses you took.\nIf you try to take the “wrong” program based on your preparation, you will run into a lot of problems with course exclusions. This is especially true if you try to take the Applied Minor when you should be taking the Minor. A consequence of this is that you may end up with too few distinct credits to graduate. (Excluded courses, ones marked Extra on your transcript and in Degree Explorer, do not count as distinct credits.)\nSpecific questions you might have are listed below.\n\nHow long does it take? Two academic years. Suggested timetable:\n\n\nacademic year 1 fall: STAB22 or equivalent, CSCA20\nyear 1 winter: STAB27 or equivalent (PSYC08 and MGEB12 are sometimes offered in the summer)\nyear 2 fall: STAC32, STAC53\nyear 2 winter: STAD29\nas offered: your courses for the last requirement.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between STAB22, STAB23, PSYB07, and MGEB11? These are all first Statistics courses aimed at students with relatively little mathematics. PSYB07 and MGEB11 are intended for students in psychology and economics for management respectively. STAB23 is intended for students in the social sciences. STAB22 is for everybody else. I only recommend taking PSYB07, MGEB11, or STAB23 if you are in one of the programs that uses those courses specifically; you will find that those courses use examples from psychology, economics and the social sciences (respectively), and so if you are studying something else, you will find the course material confusing, and you do better to take the more general STAB22 (whose examples are from a variety of fields).\nWhich second Statistics course should I take? Take the one that matches the first course you took: if you took PSYB07, take PSYC08; if you took MGEB11, take MGEB12; if you took STAB22 or STAB23, take STAB27. You may be able to take mis-matching courses, but if you do, you may find that material you need in your second course includes things you did not do in your first course.\nMy Degree Explorer says that I need STAC50, which I cannot get into, but the program requirements say STAC53. What should I do? You should take STAC53, and you should also email me with your student number so that I can change your Degree Explorer for you. (This is likely only relevant if you enrolled in the Applied Minor program some years ago.)\nCan I take STAB27 and STAC32 out of order to complete the program quicker? No. Prerequisites are enforced and you will be removed from STAC32 if you enrol. The same applies if you try to take STAD29 without having taken STAC32. Read the prerequisites carefully. The program is designed to take two academic years to complete. See question 0.\nCan I substitute other courses for STAC32, STAC53, STAD29? You can take STA 304 in place of STAC53, but otherwise no. If you want to use STA 304, you need to email me so that I can update your Degree Explorer. You should also be aware that STA 304 has a prerequisite STA 255, which itself requires a calculus course (which could be MATA34).\nI’m having trouble finding courses for requirement 5. Can I substitute something else? Maybe. The point of requirement 5 is that the two courses should have a significant quantitative component, for example actual math courses (such as calculus), or a course in or near your discipline that has a significant quantitative component. PSYC09 and GGRC42 are examples of other courses I would accept. If you wish me to consider another course beyond the ones listed in the Calendar or on your Degree Explorer, email me, if necessary making your case that the course in question has a significant quantitative compenent.\nCan I take a Statistics Specialist/Major/Minor and an Applied Statistics Minor? No.\nCan I use STAB52 and/or STAB57 to satisfy any requirements for the Applied Statistics Minor? No. You should be taking the Statistics Minor instead.\nI have taken MATA34, and also MGEB11 and MGEB12. Can I take the Applied Statistics Minor? Yes.\nI have taken, or plan to take, MATA30/A31 and MATA36/37. Should I take the Applied Statistics Minor? No. The Statistics Minor is a better fit for you.\nI have taken other first-year calculus courses, such as MATA29. Can I take the Applied Statistics Minor? If you want. You will need to take STAB22 (or equivalent) and STAB27 (or equivalent).\nI am taking a Computer Science Minor. Can I also take the Applied Statistics Minor? Yes.\nI am in Statistics Specialist, Major, Minor, or the Math Specialist, Statistics Stream. Can I also take the Applied Statistics Minor, or any of STAC32, STAC53, STAD29 for credit? No and no.\nI have questions about the Statistics Minor. Can I ask you? No. Email the Supervisor of Studies for that program.\nI want to learn some SAS. Will I be learning that in any of your courses? No, not as they are currently arranged, but you might find this site useful. You will probably recognize the data sets used there, if you have taken any of my courses.",

    "text": "bad picture\n\n\nWelcome to the home page for STAC32. This is the place to look for all things course-related (notes, assignments, announcements etc., linked above) except for assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on Quercus.\nThis is an applied course. Expect to be describing the process by which you got your answers, and explaining what the answers mean in the context of the data you are working with: that is to say, using your language skills as well as your statistical skills. Be prepared to show your understanding and insight; this course is about a lot more than “getting the answer”.\nIn real life, people do Statistics to make decisions or inform actions, and you will be expected to play your full part in that process, both in this course and in your statistical future.\n\n\n\n\n2024-12-18 15:00: The final exams are marked, coursework appeals are dealt with, grades are submitted. You should be receiving them shortly.\n\nReminders:\n\nRead section 5, Grades in the detailed course policies.\nI am not allowed to discuss or negotiate grades. Do not attempt to do so.\nIf you are unhappy with your grade, the only avenues of appeal you have are through the Registrar’s office.\nCourse grades are based only on the work you have done in a course, and not on any external circumstances. If you want a certain grade, it is up to you to do the work needed to obtain it.\n\nHappy holidays to everyone, in whatever way you celebrate. I hope to see you in D29!\n\n2024-12-17 11:45: Assignment 7 is marked, grades to be posted shortly. We are on a tight timeline, so any appeals (by the usual procedure) need to reach me by 12 noon tomorrow, Dec 18.\n2024-12-16 22:15: now 65% done.\n2024-12-14 21:10: tonight’s report: 43% done, including (I think) all of mine.\n2024-12-13 21:15: We are up to 26% done. Expect your TAs and me to devote our weekend to marking your exam. My solutions, with edits from the questions I’ve been marking. The figures are at the end.\n2024-12-12 21:30: final exam marking is under way. We are now 11% done (which is actually all me so far). Your TAs have been briefed about the marking of their questions, and they will get to it when they have a chance.\n2024-12-10 14:15:\n\nwe haven’t forgotten about Assignment 7. This will be marked and included in your course grade.\nfinal exam tomorrow. See Quercus announcement for where and when.\n\n2024-12-04 18:55: weather permitting, I’ll be in my office tomorrow (Thursday), sometime around early afternoon. (If the door is open, but I’m not there, I’m somewhere around and will be back soon.)\n2024-12-04 12:45:\n\nAssignment 8 is now marked, and the marks will be released in a moment. Appeals by the usual procedure between Dec 5 and Dec 10 (so that I can get to them before the final exam). Assignment 7 will be coming your way soon.\nin response to a question on the discussion board, I rewrote some of my solutions to worksheet 11 to fit better with the way we have been doing things.\n\n2024-12-03 11:30: final exam:\n\nthe final exam is comprehensive: you are responsible for anything in the course.\nspecifically: expect to see most of the material from after our midterm, and a selection of material from before.\n\n2024-12-02 14:45: updates:\n\nI think I am happy with the final exam. It has 37 questions worth a total of 91 points; in that regard it is not much bigger than the midterm, but I think you can expect to have to work harder for each point here than you did on the midterm.\nI will have pre-exam office hours on Monday Dec 9, 1:00-3:00pm.\nI may also be in the office this week, depending on the forecast for snow. I was thinking of Wed or Thursday, but as I write, the forecast is for snow both days, so we’ll see.\n\n2024-11-28 13:05: final exam time and location is on Quercus.\n2024-11-28 11:15: Some solutions of mine:\n\nto Assignment 8 (which closed last night)\nto Worksheet 11 from tutorial yesterday.\n\n2024-11-25 11:30: the final Monday update:\n\nAssignments:\n\nAssignment 7: my solutions\nAssignment 8 (the last one) due tonight.\n\nLectures:\n\nTuesday: functions part 1\nThursday: functions part 2. Once we are done this, we are done.\nno lectures after that (Dec 2 and Dec 3 are makeup Mondays).\n\nWorksheet 11 for tutorial on Wednesday.\n\nTutorial at 9:00am on Wednesday is cancelled. If you were going to that one, please go to one of the others (12 noon, 3:00pm, 4:00pm in the same room).\n\nThe final exam is under construction. I will let you know the number of pages and questions when it is finished.\n\n2024-11-21 22:05: My solutions to worksheet 10. Sorry for the delay, and thanks to the student who reminded me.\n2024-11-21 10:35: Assignment 6 has also been marked, and I am about to post the marks. Appeals by usual procedure between Nov 24 and Dec 1 inclusive.\n2024-11-19 10:50: Assignment 5 has been marked, and I am about to post the marks. Appeals by usual procedure between Nov 22 and Nov 29 inclusive.\n2024-11-18 11:20: Monday update (the second-to-last one):\n\nAssignments:\n\nAssignment 5 appears to be marked. When the grader confirms that it is all done, I will post the marks.\nAssignment 6 marking is under way.\nAssignment 7 is due tonight.\nAssignment 8 (the last one) opens on Wednesday and is due on Monday of next week (the 25th).\n\nLectures:\n\nTuesday: asphalt case study\nThursday: regression with categorical (explanatory) variables\nremaining: writing functions\n\nWorksheet 10 for tutorial on Wednesday. There is one more tutorial and one more worksheet after this.\n\n2024-11-14 10:30: solutions to things:\n\nAssignment 6\nWorksheet 9\n\n2024-11-11 15:15: I am about ready to post the midterm marks. You have received an email from Crowdmark with instructions for retrieving your marked exam.\n\nStats: median 57.25 (69%), Q1 45.75 (55%), Q3 70.25 (85%).\nAppeals by the same procedure as for assignments, between Nov 14 and Nov 21 inclusive. Appeals will only be considered for grading errors, that you can demonstrate by reference to my solutions. In addition, the graders have been as consistent as possible across students, so I will not consider appeals for partial credit. Hence the only thing worth appealing is an answer where you can make the case for full credit for your answer, with reference to my solutions. To do this, you will need to demonstrate that the grader didn’t see something you wrote, or graded inconsistently with my solutions.\nIf you are disappointed by your exam mark:\n\nYour first task is to go through your marked exam carefully with my solutions and understand where you earned and did not earn points.\nIf, despite your best efforts, you do not understand what you were missing, talk to me in office hours. These conversations are only about your understanding, not about your marks.\n\n\n2024-11-11 14:45: a (late) Monday update:\n\nthe midterm is marked! After I have finished checking it over, I will upload the marks to Quercus, and send you your marked exam (you will get an email from Crowdmark with your marked exam attached).\nAssignment 6 is due tonight at the usual time.\nLectures:\n\nTuesday: the last little bit of tidying data, then the windmill case study (regression).\nThursday: the rest of the windmill case study, and maybe start on the asphalt case study (multiple regression).\n\nWorksheet 9 for tutorial on Wednesday.\nThere are two more assignments after #6 and two more worksheets after #9.\n\n2024-11-10 21:10: now at 90% marked. Remaining questions seem to be 5, 6, 12, and 24. Results tomorrow, maybe.\n2024-11-09 20:50: we are now up to 68% of the midterm graded. I am done my share, and we are waiting on the TAs to finish their parts.\n2024-11-08 21:55: looks as if it’s been a productive day of marking; we are up to 53% done. I am approaching the end of my share of the marking. My updated solutions.\n2024-11-07 23:45: Midterm marking now at 38%. I did question 33 between lectures today and question 25 tonight, which was probably further than I expected to get today. (I’m working kinda backwards.) Tomorrow will be a (hopefully) productive day.\n2024-11-07 11:45: my midterm solutions as they stand now (will be updated as marking continues).\n2024-11-06 22:00: update:\n\nmy worksheet 8 solutions. I messed up getting these to the TAs in time, so if your TA seemed underinformed in tutorial today, that was my fault.\nexam marking progress report: we are 28% done as of right now. I got through most of the ANOVA question today. I aim to do some more in between the two lectures tomorrow. It’s always a challenge to mark midterms while simultaneously keeping track of everything else in the course. Hence, you might need to remind me in lecture tomorrow (Thursday) of where we got to on Tuesday.\n\n2024-11-03 16:45: an early “Monday update”:\n\nMidterm on Monday night! See Quercus announcement for time and place(s).\nThere are no assignments due this week. Assignment 6 will be due on Mon Nov 11, and there will be two more assignments after that.\nLectures:\n\nTuesday: the first part of tidying data\nThursday: the second part of tidying data\n\nWorksheet 8 for tutorial on Wednesday.\n\n2024-10-30 13:15: course grade procedures:\n\nif you miss the midterm for any reason, the weight is automatically transferred to the final exam (you don’t have to ask me or provide documentation).\nif you write the midterm, but your final exam is better, your final exam automatically counts instead of your midterm.\ntherefore, it is in your best interest to write the midterm if you can: it is “marks in the bank” if you do well, and is ignored if you do better on the final.\non the other hand, if you are sick on exam day (particularly if you have something that is contagious or will disturb the person sitting next to you), stay home.\n\n2024-10-29 23:40: reminder of pre-exam office hours Wed 2:00-4:00pm in my office (see course outline for where that is).\n2024-10-25 17:00: when I was a bit younger than you are now (that is to say, a long time ago now), I was given some tips about writing exams, which I pass on below. This exam has 33 questions grouped together under a number of “scenarios” with a title at the top (as on the assignments and worksheets); you will probably want to attempt the questions for a particular scenario together:\n\nbudget your time. For my exams (and, I suspect, for most exams), the number of points is a reasonable proxy for the amount of time that it will take for a well-prepared student to answer the question. You know how many total points the exam is worth (see yesterday’s note), and you know how many minutes you have, so you know how long things should be taking. If you can, allow yourself a few minutes at the end for checking your answers.\nbefore you answer any of the questions, read (or at least skim) through the whole exam, and note anything that you know how to answer.\nstart with the questions that look easiest, and make sure you get the points for those.\nif a question is taking you too long (given your time budget), leave it and do another one. Your job is not to do all the questions, but to get as many points as possible. If you spend too long on a question, you are stopping yourself from getting points elsewhere. The worst thing is to not even attempt questions that you know how to do.\nif you follow the principle of doing the easiest remaining questions at any point, anything you don’t have time for will be something that you weren’t going to get many points on anyway. (Note how different this is from the strategy of starting at the beginning and continuing until you run out of time.)\n\n2024-10-25 16:40:\n\nI added last year’s exams to the old exam page. In contrast to this year, last year’s midterm was early, so there is a lot of material that can be on this year’s midterm that was not on last year’s. Midterms vary in how far through the semester they are, so be careful about using previous midterms as a guide to what will appear on this year’s.\nI used to teach SAS in this course as well as R, so if you go back far enough, you will find questions on SAS in the exams. You can ignore those, or, perhaps better, think about how you would accomplish the same task with R.\nAlso, if you go back far enough, you may in addition find R things done differently from how they are now. This is the nature of a course using developing software. Your aim is to do these tasks as they are done now, meaning as I am teaching them this year. There are, I think, some notes in my solutions indicating how things have changed, but I doubt I have caught everything. I plan to take another look at those during reading week and see what I can fix up.\n\n2024-10-24 15:50: I think I am happy with the midterm. It has 33 numbered questions worth a total of 83 points, some of which are writing code and some of which are explaining things.\n2024-10-24 11:30: a quick Thursday update:\n\nreminder that next week is Reading Week: no lectures or tutorials.\nI forgot to tell you where one of the data files was on Assignment 6! This is now fixed (thank you to the student who noticed it).\nMy solutions to Assignment 5.\nMy solutions to Worksheet 7.\nI intend to hold pre-exam office hours on about Wednesday of next week (during reading week). I’m anticipating 2:00-4:00pm in my office.\n\n2024-10-21 12:30: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 5 is due tonight. If you are having difficulty installing smmr, make sure you have read the lecture notes and see the discussion on Quercus, or see the smmr homepage for another way.\nAssignment 4 marking is done. My solutions. I will post the marks shortly. Appeals by the usual process between Oct 24 and Oct 31 inclusive. Common errors (according to the TA): missing the alternative in question 5 (and hence getting a different answer in question 6); not considering sample size in question 8).\nAssignment 6 will open on Wed night. This is rather long (sorry!), but it is not due until Nov 11, so you have almost three weeks to do it.\nLectures:\n\nTuesday: the last bit of matched pairs, then the start of analysis of variance.\nThursday: The rest of analysis of variance.\n\nWorksheet 7 for tutorial on Wednesday. This is again rather long, because I wanted to give you practice on everything that might appear on the midterm. Questions 1-10 should be doable after Tuesday’s lecture, but you might want to wait until after Thursday’s lecture before tackling the rest of it. I will post all my solutions on Wednesday as usual, but (see note 2024-10-20 16:00) you should not look at my solutions to question 11 and on until after you have made an honest attempt at solving them yourself.\n\n2024-10-20 16:00:\n\nOne of the most powerful ways to find out whether you know something is to solve problems on it, and when you have given the problems your best effort, then you look at the solutions and grade yourself. It then becomes very clear where any gaps in your knowledge are, and you know what to go back and study again. This is why I give you my worksheets first, and then later give you the solutions, and why I post my detailed solutions to the assignments after you have had a chance to work on them. (I will post my solutions to the midterm after you have written it, for the same reason. You will be able to see your graded exam, so you should go through that with my solutions.)\nThis means that the best way you have of studying for the midterm is, after reading through your lecture notes:\n\ngo to tutorial and do the worksheets yourself, then look at my solutions and grade yourself.\ndo the assignments yourself, and afterwards look at my solutions and see what you were missing.\nif you want more practice, look at the problems in PASIAS. Each problem appears twice in its chapter, the first time without answers, the second time with. Attempt the problem as it appears without answers, then read the same problem as it appears with answers and grade yourself.\nafter you have graded yourself, go back to your lecture notes and re-read the things you are weak on (and, ideally, when you are ready, do another practice problem to see whether you understand it now).\nThere are old midterms. Use these in the same way: write the ones without answers first, under exam conditions with the notes you intend to bring to the actual exam, and then grade yourself using my solutions. Be mindful that in some of the older exams I do things differently from how I do them now. If you are confused by any of those, ask on the Quercus discussion board. See also Brian Harrington’s reddit post on using old exams.\nIf you don’t do these things (for example, you read through things with answers instead of taking the time to solve these problems yourself), you are setting yourself up to struggle in my exams, because solving my problems without knowing what the answers are is literally what you will need to do on the exams.\n\nAll this applies in any STEM-like course where later material depends on earlier material. You learn by solving problems (yourself) like the ones you will see on the exam, and preferably enough of them that you are ready for anything that might appear on the exam. There is no shortcut to success apart from this.\n\n2024-10-20 15:55: I had a couple of questions about read.csv last week after class. The key thing for you to know is that I did not teach this as a way of reading in a CSV file, so that in this course it is wrong and only read_csv with an underscore is correct. To have any hope of getting credit for using it, you need to say in your assignment where you got it from, and to say why it is better for the purpose than what I taught you. (It is too late to put that in an appeal.) It is also rather a signal that you got help from outside the course, and I warned you in the syllabus that this is unlikely to help you in the long run.\n2024-10-16 23:30: A late-night check-in:\n\nAssignment 3 is graded. Appeals by the same procedure as for Assignments 1 and 2, between Oct 19 and Oct 26 inclusive. Added 2024-10-21 12:45: Common errors: questions 1 and 5 use of read.csv (see note 2024-10-20 15:55); question 4 and 9 failure to mention sample size and overcoming the skewness; question 7 and 8 make sure to use greater.\nMy solutions to Worksheet 6.\n\n2024-10-11 13:15: An early “Monday update”, since Monday is a holiday:\n\nAssignment 4 is due on Tuesday night.\nAssignment 3 marking is under way. My solutions.\nAssignment 5 will open on Wed night.\nLectures next week, approximately:\n\nTuesday: the last little bit of sign test, then normal quantile plots.\nThursday: Mood’s median test\n\nWorksheet 6 for tutorial on Wednesday. You should be able to do the first question now, and the second one after (next) Tuesday’s lecture.\n\n2024-10-09 22:30: my worksheet 5 solutions.\n2024-10-09 15:30: I have taken a look at the appeals for Assignment 1. You should have a comment from me on Quercus, together with a possibly adjusted mark.\n2024-10-09 12:30: about the midterm:\n\nThe date, time, and place of the midterm is in an announcement on Quercus, edited today. I am not announcing these to people outside the class.\nThe midterm is open-book. You can bring what you wish, such as your lecture notes, assignments, my slides, assignment solutions, etc, printed (no computers or other devices at the exam). You will need to organize whatever you bring, so that you can quickly find what you are looking for (and so there is an upper limit on what there is any point in bringing). If you are not well prepared, you can expect to run out of time; you will not have time to look everything up or go searching for things.\nThe exam coverage is everything that is done in lecture up to and including Thursday Oct 24. This is currently scheduled to include up to Analysis of Variance, but that may change. If I haven’t talked about it in class by the end of that day’s lecture, it’s not on the exam.\nExpect to be writing code and explanations (for example, I might ask for code to do a task, or give you code or output and ask questions about it).\nAt the exam, you will get an exam paper with spaces to write your answers, and you also get a booklet with numbered Figures to refer to during the exam. The exam will say things like “In Figure 10, what is…” and you will need to find Figure 10 in the other booklet.\nThis is a Crowdmark exam, so it is best to use a pen or a sharp pencil, otherwise we may have trouble reading your answers. (Your exam will be scanned and then marked online, so if we cannot read the scan of your writing, we cannot give it points.) Only the front of the pages will be scanned, so do not write anything on the back of the pages, since no-one will see it. I add a blank page at the end of the exam which you can use for writing answers if you run out of space elsewhere.\nThe exam will have some number of numbered questions worth 2 or 3 or 4 or so points each, as on the assignments. I will tell you later how many questions there are.\nif you have an exam accommodation, you will be writing with Accessability, and should make arrangements with them.\nAny questions about exam procedures should go in Quercus discussions.\n\n2024-10-07 11:00: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 3 is due tonight.\nAssignment 2 has been marked, and I will release the marks shortly. Appeals between Oct 10 and 17 inclusive by the procedure described at 2024-09-27 11:25.\nAssignment 4 will open on Wed night.\nLectures this week, approximately:\n\nTuesday: the rest of power of hypothesis tests\nThursday: the sign test. After that is normal quantile plots.\n\nWorksheet 5 for tutorial on Wednesday (which should be doable after Tuesday’s lecture, and will prepare you for Assignment 4).\n\n2024-10-02 18:45: dinner is on the way, and I fixed my solutions.\n2024-10-02 18:10: a temporary version of my solutions to worksheet 4. I realized that I put the wrong plot in for question 6 (we haven’t seen the normal quantile plot in lecture yet), so will fix this, but I need to eat dinner first.\n2024-09-30 11:10: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 2 is due tonight.\nLectures:\n\nTuesday: bootstrap sampling distribution of the sample mean (this will help us answer the question of “is our sample big enough for the Central Limit Theorem to help?”)\nThursday: power of hypothesis tests (this may spill into next week)\n\nTutorial: Worksheet 4\nAssignment 3, on the same material as Worksheet 4, will open on Wednesday night.\n\n2024-09-27 11:25: Assignment 1 is now graded. I will release the marks shortly:\n\nMy solutions\nIf you wish to appeal your mark, you will need to follow the procedures given here precisely, in particular items 18–22 in section 3. In short, you need to find an error in the marking, and you need to explain clearly what that error is and how your work is in fact a correct answer to the question. Grader’s judgement is not an error, and not liking your mark is in no way grounds for an appeal. The time window for appeals on Assignment 1 is September 30 - October 7 inclusive. Appeals sent outside that window will not be considered.\n\n2024-09-25 20:30: My solutions to worksheet 3. Assignment 2 should now be open.\n2024-09-24 12:15: We have an official second section of STAD29, which will run Monday 1-3pm (one two-hour lecture a week, same as the other section). It should be big enough to accommodate all the students currently on the waitlist. If you are in section 1 currently and want to move to the new second section, that should be possible (which would allow space for students currently on the waitlist to join section 1, if that suits them better).\n2024-09-23 11:50: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 1 due tonight.\nLectures: I got to the end of “choosing things” last Thursday, so we have for this week:\n\nTuesday: one-sample \\(t\\)\nThursday: two-sample \\(t\\) and start of bootstrap for sample mean\n\nTutorial: Worksheet 3 questions. Questions 18 and 19 relate to Tuesday’s lecture this week.\nAssignment 2 will open on Wednesday night.\n\n2024-09-22 15:00: If you are having trouble accessing the assignment, your first port of call should be the student computer helpdesk to find out why that is (you are probably also going to have trouble handing in the assignment if you do not get this sorted out). For this week only, here are the questions.\n2024-09-19 15:30: I just took a look through the Assignment 0’s. If you got a 1 and a “yep”, you are all good. Most people got both of those. If you handed in something and didn’t get a 1, or got a 1 and a comment, you need to figure out what happened. The commonest things missing were the embed-resources: true thing that meant that there were no graphs, and the df-print: paged thing that meant that there was no nice display of dataframes. See question 13 in worksheet 1; these go in the “YAML block” at the very top of your document. If you got a 0, you are welcome to try again and I will endeavour to take a look at your revised version. (I was pretty relaxed about what you included; if you had some code, some output and a graph, ideally with some text of your own, I was good with it.)\n2024-09-19 10:35: two things:\n\nAssignment 1 is now open, due next Monday.\nSeptember 16 was the last day to register yourself in a tutorial. If you haven’t done so yet, you will now need to go through the Registrar’s office to do this.\n\n2024-09-19 00:15: before I go to bed, my solutions to Worksheet 2.\n2024-09-18 12:00: We have a date for the midterm. I don’t want to share the time and place in public, so I am about to post an announcement on Quercus so that you can make plans.\n2024-09-16 12:55: Assignment 1 is now on Quercus, and will open for you on Wed night. Note that it is available until Wed of next week, but it is due on Monday night, and there is a late penalty (1% per hour) if you submit it after 11:59pm Monday. If you have an official Accessibility accommodation that grants you an extension on assignments, it is up to you to claim it (by emailing me) before the official due date each time you need it. The maximum such extension is two days, since I will be publishing solutions for everyone after that. There are no other extensions or make-ups, as per the syllabus. You may hand in your assignment up to two days late, but the late penalty will apply. (You will recall from your reading of the syllabus that the worst two assignments are dropped; if life circumstances intervene and you cannot hand in an assignment before it closes, that will automatically count as one of your dropped assignments.)\n2024-09-16 12:15: Monday update:\n\nlectures: the rest of numerical summaries (Tuesday), choosing things from dataframes (both days), one-sample \\(t\\) (start Thursday).\ntutorial: worksheet 2. Note that this week (and from here forward) this only has the questions. The idea is that by learning how to do the worksheet yourself (using your lecture notes and your brain), you are also learning how to do the assignment that depends on this worksheet (and thereby preparing yourself for any midterm questions on the material in this worksheet). After you have made an honest effort on this worksheet yourself, feel free to ask your tutorial TA for guidance if you get stuck. I will post my solutions on Wed evening.\nassignment 1 will be posted on Wednesday evening, after all the tutorials are done and I have posted my worksheet solutions, and will be due the following Monday night (at the traditional time of 11:59pm). The idea is that you do the assignment yourself, based on what you have learned from doing the worksheet (and from the material in your lecture notes and by using your brain); expect minimal help from me. You have practiced the submission procedure on worksheet 1 (“assignment 0”), so you should be able to figure that out for Assignment 1.\n\n2024-09-11 18:00: to answer the question from lecture: if you’re reading in data from an Excel sheet, can you get hold of the names of the sheets in R, so that you can figure out which one contains the data you want? The answer turns out to be yes. To use the test2.xlsx from lecture:\n\n\nlibrary(readxl)\nbook &lt;- \"test2.xlsx\"\nexcel_sheets(book)\n\n[1] \"data\"  \"notes\"\n\n\nand hence\n\nxy &lt;- read_excel(book, \"data\")\nxy\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  id        x     y group\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n1 p1       10    21 upper\n2 p2       11    20 lower\n3 p3       13    25 upper\n4 p4       15    27 lower\n5 p5       16    30 upper\n6 p6       17    31 lower\n\n\nCoding tip: I knew I was going to be referring to the spreadsheet file twice (once to get the names of the sheets in it, and once to access the sheet I wanted), so I saved the filename (in book, short for “workbook”) to avoid typing the filename twice. (I also gave the dataframe a name that says at least something about what it contains, even though we don’t know what x and y actually are.)\n\n2024-09-09 13:20: on the table for this week:\n\nlectures:\n\nthe rest of reading files (Tuesday, to start)\nmaking graphs (Tuesday)\nnumerical summaries (Thursday)\nchoosing things from dataframes (possibly Thursday, possibly next week)\n\ntutorials: start this week, on Wednesday. Your chance to work through (or finish working through) Worksheet 1 with a TA there to help, as well as handing in the practice Assignment 0 (checking that your graphs successfully made it).\n\n2024-09-06 13:00: I thought I would write out my plans for the course and share them with you (Google sheet):\n\nI went about as far as reading week, because I am usually too ambitious. Expect there to be edits material-wise.\nThere is a midterm to be scheduled; I try not to have an assignment and a midterm the same week (eg. if the midterm is on a Friday, there won’t be an assignment due the Monday after).\nThis means that the last assignment will probably end up being due on Nov 25 and not as shown. Expect that the material in assignment \\(n\\) will be the same as on worksheet \\(n+1\\) (the questions will of course be different), at least up until the midterm when things might get further out of sync.\nDepending on when the midterm is scheduled, the last tutorial before it might be a chance for you to bring exam-related questions to the TA.\nI made assignment 4 due the day after Thanksgiving rather than Thanksgiving itself.\n\n2024-09-05 10:20: Today’s class: reading in data. Files for today’s class (added after: it looks as if they all work now):\n\nTest 1 (xlsx)\nTest 1 (csv)\nCoffee cups\nMigraine data\nTest 2 (xlsx)\n\n2024-09-04 17:30: I think I forgot to mention exams in my go-through of the course outline on Tuesday. The information you need is on the Assessment page of the course outline, at the bottom (you might need to scroll down).\n2024-09-03 12:50: Worksheet 1, for tutorial next week, in case you want to start on it now.\n2024-09-03 11:30: There were three fourth-year students on the waitlist this morning, and I have asked for them to be added to the course. Otherwise, the course is full because the classrooms for both lecture sections are full.\n2024-08-29 14:30: there is indeed a fourth tutorial:\n\nSince there has been some last-minute reorganization, tutorials start in week 2 this year. This means that some of the early worksheets (and therefore assignments) will be a bit behind what appears in the lectures, but we will catch up as we go. The first worksheet should actually be doable after the very first lecture, so I will make sure it’s up in case you want to start on it right away. It looks as if there will be eight assignments this year (the first one will be due after week 3), of which the best six will count.\nIf you are still on the waitlist, it’s up to you to register yourself for the new LEC02. Also, if you are in LEC01 but would rather be in LEC02, you should be able to move to that section.\n\n2024-08-28 14:20: there will soon be a fourth tutorial (on Wednesday in BV 498, like the others, is the plan). It doesn’t matter which lecture section you are in; the tutorials are all good for both sections.\n2024-08-27 11:40: we have a second lecture section, and there should be space in it for everyone on the waitlist as of right now:\n\nthe lectures for LEC02 (taught by me as well) are Tu 15:00-16:00 and Th 17:00-18:00\nif you are currently on the waitlist, you can sign up for LEC02 right away\nthere will be tutorial space for everyone on Wed (it doesn’t matter which tutorial you are in, because the two lecture sections will run in parallel). Expect a fourth tutorial to be created soon. You have (I think) the option to switch tutorials, up to a certain date. Since things are in a chaotic state right now, I may switch the tutorials back to starting in week 2 (and not what I said on August 12).\nAcorn will tell you the locations of everything.\nThe times for LEC01 are unchanged.\nif you are currently in LEC01 and want to switch to LEC02, you can do that, which would allow people on the waitlist/in LEC02 to switch to LEC01 if that suits them better.\n\n2024-08-23 15:45: breaking news: we are seeing whether we can open a second section of this course. This is contingent on being able to find a classroom to hold it in at a time that those of you on the waitlist (and I) can manage, which (as is usually the case at UTSC) is the biggest part of the problem. Expect more news early next week. (If need be, we will also hold a second section of STAD29, so there will be room in any case in that course for everyone that makes it through STAC32.)\n2024-08-12 12:00:\n\nA reminder that the course is full because the lecture room is full, and so I cannot admit any more students even if I wanted to.\nThe course outline, so that you can get a sense of what to expect.\nHighlights:\n\nlectures on Tuesday and Thursday (1 hour each)\ntutorial on Wednesday in a computer lab, starting in week 1. In tutorial, you get a worksheet to work through using R with TA help if you get stuck. The first worksheet takes you through things from the very beginning and comes with answers, including a practice assignment hand-in. Later worksheets don’t come with answers (so you have to work it out yourself), but I will publish answers after each week’s tutorials are done.\ntutorial worksheets prepare you for the assignments.\nassignments are due weekly on Mondays and open the previous Wednesday night (the first one opens in week 2 and is due the Monday of week 3), on the same material that the previous worksheet was on. Your assignment answers will need to show code, output, and explanation of the results. (The practice assignment shows you what is needed.) I publish complete solutions after each assignment has been handed in.\nif you do your own work on the worksheets, this will help you for the assignments; if you do your own work on the assignments, this will help you on the exams and will thus help your course grade.\nthere will be one out-of-class midterm on a date to be announced, around halfway through the course.\nthere will be a final exam, also on a date to be announced, during the final exam period.\nexams are handwritten with short-answer questions, some of which may ask you to write code. Exams are open-book, but bear in mind that you need to organize what you bring, or else you will run out of time trying to find things.\nthe course materials (and your brain) will contain everything you need to succeed in this course, except for a few places where I ask you to find something out.\n\n\n2024-07-29 10:45:\n\nI have found space for a few more students in the course, and have asked for these students to be added. Once this is done, the course will be full, since we will be at maximum capacity for our lecture room and I am not allowed to enlarge the class any further.\nIn the next couple of days, you will see either that you have been enrolled in the course or that you have moved up the waitlist. A warning that the waitlist in this class historically moves very slowly, so if you are still on the waitlist after this, I advise you to make backup plans for your courses.\nThe waitlist is long, so I had to make some choices about who to admit. Since STAC32 and STAD29 are two of the last courses in the Statistics Applied Minor program, I prioritized those students in the program who are closest to graduating, on the basis that this may be their last year, whereas students who are further from graduating can take these courses next year. This is based on the number of credits that each student will have completed by the end of the summer (assuming they pass any summer courses), with the students on the waitlist ranked from greatest to least. If you are in your 3rd year of study (as determined by UTSC), you need to be very close to the 14.0 credits that will make you 4th year to get in this time (if you don’t, you will have a higher priority next year).\nYou can find your total number of credits in your Degree Explorer: under Degree and Completed Credits you will see something like 17.00/20.00 (includes 7.00 In Progress). This student will have 17.0 credits once they have completed the courses they are now enrolled in, and thus they have \\(17-7 = 10\\) credits completed now and are in their 3rd year of study.\nMy decision of students to enrol is final and is not open to appeal, and, as I say, the course is full once these students are enrolled because the lecture room is full.\n\n2024-06-28 19:00: time to open things up for the fall 2024 edition of this course:\n\nI’m aware that the course is filling up fast. After the 3rd years have had a chance to enrol, I will look more carefully at who is on the waitlist, with the aim of making sure that those who really need the course are able to take it, subject to space being available. My priority order is: students in the Statistics Applied Minor program, and within those, students in the fourth year of study (or beyond) as calculated by UTSC, then students in earlier years of study in the program, and then students in other programs. Appealing directly to me will not change that.\nThere are (COVID-era old) recordings of the lecture material. Things have changed since they were made, but they will be available in case you must miss an occasional lecture (for example, you are sick). They are not a substitute for routinely missing lecture; if you do that, you risk missing important material and thereby hurting your grade.\nI will be checking prerequisites. To take STAC32, you must have completed (by the time STAC32 starts in September) either STAB27 or PSYC08 or MGEB12. If you have not completed one of these courses by then, you will be removed from STAC32.\nLooking ahead to next winter’s STAD29: my aim is to make sure that there will be enough space in that course for everyone that wants to take it (and has completed STAC32).\nProgram FAQ.",

Appeals will only be considered for grading errors, that you can demonstrate by reference to my solutions. In addition, the graders have been as consistent as possible across students, so I will not consider appeals for partial credit. Hence the only thing worth appealing is an answer where you can make the case for full credit for your answer, with reference to my solutions. To do this, you will need to demonstrate that the grader didn’t see something you wrote, or graded inconsistently with my solutions.\nIf you are disappointed by your exam mark:\n\nYour first task is to go through your marked exam carefully with my solutions and understand where you earned and did not earn points.\nIf, despite your best efforts, you do not understand what you were missing, talk to me in office hours.

I messed up getting these to the TAs in time, so if your TA seemed underinformed in tutorial today, that was my fault.\nexam marking progress report: we are 28% done as of right now. I got through most of the ANOVA question today. I aim to do some more in between the two lectures tomorrow. It’s always a challenge to mark midterms while simultaneously keeping track of everything else in the course. Hence, you might need to remind me in lecture tomorrow (Thursday) of where we got to on Tuesday.\n\n2024-11-03 16:45: an early “Monday update”:\n\nMidterm on Monday night! See Quercus announcement for time and place(s).\nThere are no assignments due this week. Assignment 6 will be due on Mon Nov 11, and there will be two more assignments after that.\nLectures:\n\nTuesday: the first part of tidying data\nThursday: the second part of tidying data\n\nWorksheet 8 for tutorial on Wednesday.\n\n2024-10-30 13:15: course grade procedures:\n\nif you miss the midterm for any reason, the weight is automatically transferred to the final exam (you don’t have to ask me or provide documentation).\nif you write the midterm, but your final exam is better, your final exam automatically counts instead of your midterm.\ntherefore, it is in your best interest to write the midterm if you can: it is “marks in the bank” if you do well, and is ignored if you do better on the final.\non the other hand, if you are sick on exam day (particularly if you have something that is contagious or will disturb the person sitting next to you), stay home.\n\n2024-10-29 23:40: reminder of pre-exam office hours Wed 2:00-4:00pm in my office (see course outline for where that is).\n2024-10-25 17:00: when I was a bit younger than you are now (that is to say, a long time ago now), I was given some tips about writing exams, which I pass on below. This exam has 33 questions grouped together under a number of “scenarios” with a title at the top (as on the assignments and worksheets); you will probably want to attempt the questions for a particular scenario together:\n\nbudget your time. For my exams (and, I suspect, for most exams), the number of points is a reasonable proxy for the amount of time that it will take for a well-prepared student to answer the question. You know how many total points the exam is worth (see yesterday’s note), and you know how many minutes you have, so you know how long things should be taking. If you can, allow yourself a few minutes at the end for checking your answers.\nbefore you answer any of the questions, read (or at least skim) through the whole exam, and note anything that you know how to answer.\nstart with the questions that look easiest, and make sure you get the points for those.\nif a question is taking you too long (given your time budget), leave it and do another one. Your job is not to do all the questions, but to get as many points as possible. If you spend too long on a question, you are stopping yourself from getting points elsewhere. The worst thing is to not even attempt questions that you know how to do.\nif you follow the principle of doing the easiest remaining questions at any point, anything you don’t have time for will be something that you weren’t going to get many points on anyway. (Note how different this is from the strategy of starting at the beginning and continuing until you run out of time.)\n\n2024-10-25 16:40:\n\nI added last year’s exams to the old exam page. In contrast to this year, last year’s midterm was early, so there is a lot of material that can be on this year’s midterm that was not on last year’s. Midterms vary in how far through the semester they are, so be careful about using previous midterms as a guide to what will appear on this year’s.\nI used to teach SAS in this course as well as R, so if you go back far enough, you will find questions on SAS in the exams. You can ignore those, or, perhaps better, think about how you would accomplish the same task with R.\nAlso, if you go back far enough, you may in addition find R things done differently from how they are now. This is the nature of a course using developing software. Your aim is to do these tasks as they are done now, meaning as I am teaching them this year. There are, I think, some notes in my solutions indicating how things have changed, but I doubt I have caught everything. I plan to take another look at those during reading week and see what I can fix up.\n\n2024-10-24 15:50: I think I am happy with the midterm. It has 33 numbered questions worth a total of 83 points, some of which are writing code and some of which are explaining things.\n2024-10-24 11:30: a quick Thursday update:\n\nreminder that next week is Reading Week: no lectures or tutorials.\nI forgot to tell you where one of the data files was on Assignment 6! This is now fixed (thank you to the student who noticed it).\nMy solutions to Assignment 5.\nMy solutions to Worksheet 7.\nI intend to hold pre-exam office hours on about Wednesday of next week (during reading week). I’m anticipating 2:00-4:00pm in my office.\n\n2024-10-21 12:30: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 5 is due tonight. If you are having difficulty installing smmr, make sure you have read the lecture notes and see the discussion on Quercus, or see the smmr homepage for another way.\nAssignment 4 marking is done. My solutions. I will post the marks shortly. Appeals by the usual process between Oct 24 and Oct 31 inclusive. Common errors (according to the TA): missing the alternative in question 5 (and hence getting a different answer in question 6); not considering sample size in question 8).\nAssignment 6 will open on Wed night. This is rather long (sorry!), but it is not due until Nov 11, so you have almost three weeks to do it.\nLectures:\n\nTuesday: the last bit of matched pairs, then the start of analysis of variance.\nThursday: The rest of analysis of variance.\n\nWorksheet 7 for tutorial on Wednesday. This is again rather long, because I wanted to give you practice on everything that might appear on the midterm. Questions 1-10 should be doable after Tuesday’s lecture, but you might want to wait until after Thursday’s lecture before tackling the rest of it. I will post all my solutions on Wednesday as usual, but (see note 2024-10-20 16:00) you should not look at my solutions to question 11 and on until after you have made an honest attempt at solving them yourself.\n\n2024-10-20 16:00:\n\nOne of the most powerful ways to find out whether you know something is to solve problems on it, and when you have given the problems your best effort, then you look at the solutions and grade yourself. It then becomes very clear where any gaps in your knowledge are, and you know what to go back and study again. This is why I give you my worksheets first, and then later give you the solutions, and why I post my detailed solutions to the assignments after you have had a chance to work on them. (I will post my solutions to the midterm after you have written it, for the same reason. You will be able to see your graded exam, so you should go through that with my solutions.)\nThis means that the best way you have of studying for the midterm is, after reading through your lecture notes:\n\ngo to tutorial and do the worksheets yourself, then look at my solutions and grade yourself.\ndo the assignments yourself, and afterwards look at my solutions and see what you were missing.\nif you want more practice, look at the problems in PASIAS. Each problem appears twice in its chapter, the first time without answers, the second time with. Attempt the problem as it appears without answers, then read the same problem as it appears with answers and grade yourself.\nafter you have graded yourself, go back to your lecture notes and re-read the things you are weak on (and, ideally, when you are ready, do another practice problem to see whether you understand it now).\nThere are old midterms. Use these in the same way: write the ones without answers first, under exam conditions with the notes you intend to bring to the actual exam, and then grade yourself using my solutions. Be mindful that in some of the older exams I do things differently from how I do them now. If you are confused by any of those, ask on the Quercus discussion board. See also Brian Harrington’s reddit post on using old exams.\nIf you don’t do these things (for example, you read through things with answers instead of taking the time to solve these problems yourself), you are setting yourself up to struggle in my exams, because solving my problems without knowing what the answers are is literally what you will need to do on the exams.\n\nAll this applies in any STEM-like course where later material depends on earlier material. You learn by solving problems (yourself) like the ones you will see on the exam, and preferably enough of them that you are ready for anything that might appear on the exam. There is no shortcut to success apart from this.\n\n2024-10-20 15:55: I had a couple of questions about read.csv last week after class. The key thing for you to know is that I did not teach this as a way of reading in a CSV file, so that in this course it is wrong and only read_csv with an underscore is correct. To have any hope of getting credit for using it, you need to say in your assignment where you got it from, and to say why it is better for the purpose than what I taught you. (It is too late to put that in an appeal.) It is also rather a signal that you got help from outside the course, and I warned you in the syllabus that this is unlikely to help you in the long run.\n2024-10-16 23:30: A late-night check-in:\n\nAssignment 3 is graded. Appeals by the same procedure as for Assignments 1 and 2, between Oct 19 and Oct 26 inclusive. Added 2024-10-21 12:45: Common errors: questions 1 and 5 use of read.csv (see note 2024-10-20 15:55); question 4 and 9 failure to mention sample size and overcoming the skewness; question 7 and 8 make sure to use greater.\nMy solutions to Worksheet 6.\n\n2024-10-11 13:15: An early “Monday update”, since Monday is a holiday:\n\nAssignment 4 is due on Tuesday night.\nAssignment 3 marking is under way. My solutions.\nAssignment 5 will open on Wed night.\nLectures next week, approximately:\n\nTuesday: the last little bit of sign test, then normal quantile plots.\nThursday: Mood’s median test\n\nWorksheet 6 for tutorial on Wednesday. You should be able to do the first question now, and the second one after (next) Tuesday’s lecture.\n\n2024-10-09 22:30: my worksheet 5 solutions.\n2024-10-09 15:30: I have taken a look at the appeals for Assignment 1. You should have a comment from me on Quercus, together with a possibly adjusted mark.\n2024-10-09 12:30: about the midterm:\n\nThe date, time, and place of the midterm is in an announcement on Quercus, edited today. I am not announcing these to people outside the class.\nThe midterm is open-book. You can bring what you wish, such as your lecture notes, assignments, my slides, assignment solutions, etc, printed (no computers or other devices at the exam). You will need to organize whatever you bring, so that you can quickly find what you are looking for (and so there is an upper limit on what there is any point in bringing). If you are not well prepared, you can expect to run out of time; you will not have time to look everything up or go searching for things.\nThe exam coverage is everything that is done in lecture up to and including Thursday Oct 24. This is currently scheduled to include up to Analysis of Variance, but that may change. If I haven’t talked about it in class by the end of that day’s lecture, it’s not on the exam.\nExpect to be writing code and explanations (for example, I might ask for code to do a task, or give you code or output and ask questions about it).\nAt the exam, you will get an exam paper with spaces to write your answers, and you also get a booklet with numbered Figures to refer to during the exam. The exam will say things like “In Figure 10, what is…” and you will need to find Figure 10 in the other booklet.\nThis is a Crowdmark exam, so it is best to use a pen or a sharp pencil, otherwise we may have trouble reading your answers. (Your exam will be scanned and then marked online, so if we cannot read the scan of your writing, we cannot give it points.) Only the front of the pages will be scanned, so do not write anything on the back of the pages, since no-one will see it. I add a blank page at the end of the exam which you can use for writing answers if you run out of space elsewhere.\nThe exam will have some number of numbered questions worth 2 or 3 or 4 or so points each, as on the assignments. I will tell you later how many questions there are.\nif you have an exam accommodation, you will be writing with Accessability, and should make arrangements with them.\nAny questions about exam procedures should go in Quercus discussions.\n\n2024-10-07 11:00: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 3 is due tonight.\nAssignment 2 has been marked, and I will release the marks shortly. Appeals between Oct 10 and 17 inclusive by the procedure described at 2024-09-27 11:25.\nAssignment 4 will open on Wed night.\nLectures this week, approximately:\n\nTuesday: the rest of power of hypothesis tests\nThursday: the sign test. After that is normal quantile plots.\n\nWorksheet 5 for tutorial on Wednesday (which should be doable after Tuesday’s lecture, and will prepare you for Assignment 4).\n\n2024-10-02 18:45: dinner is on the way, and I fixed my solutions.\n2024-10-02 18:10: a temporary version of my solutions to worksheet 4. I realized that I put the wrong plot in for question 6 (we haven’t seen the normal quantile plot in lecture yet), so will fix this, but I need to eat dinner first.\n2024-09-30 11:10: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 2 is due tonight.\nLectures:\n\nTuesday: bootstrap sampling distribution of the sample mean (this will help us answer the question of “is our sample big enough for the Central Limit Theorem to help?”)\nThursday: power of hypothesis tests (this may spill into next week)\n\nTutorial: Worksheet 4\nAssignment 3, on the same material as Worksheet 4, will open on Wednesday night.\n\n2024-09-27 11:25: Assignment 1 is now graded. I will release the marks shortly:\n\nMy solutions\nIf you wish to appeal your mark, you will need to follow the procedures given here precisely, in particular items 18–22 in section 3. In short, you need to find an error in the marking, and you need to explain clearly what that error is and how your work is in fact a correct answer to the question. Grader’s judgement is not an error, and not liking your mark is in no way grounds for an appeal. The time window for appeals on Assignment 1 is September 30 - October 7 inclusive. Appeals sent outside that window will not be considered.\n\n2024-09-25 20:30: My solutions to worksheet 3. Assignment 2 should now be open.\n2024-09-24 12:15: We have an official second section of STAD29, which will run Monday 1-3pm (one two-hour lecture a week, same as the other section). It should be big enough to accommodate all the students currently on the waitlist. If you are in section 1 currently and want to move to the new second section, that should be possible (which would allow space for students currently on the waitlist to join section 1, if that suits them better).\n2024-09-23 11:50: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 1 due tonight.\nLectures: I got to the end of “choosing things” last Thursday, so we have for this week:\n\nTuesday: one-sample \\(t\\)\nThursday: two-sample \\(t\\) and start of bootstrap for sample mean\n\nTutorial: Worksheet 3 questions. Questions 18 and 19 relate to Tuesday’s lecture this week.\nAssignment 2 will open on Wednesday night.\n\n2024-09-22 15:00: If you are having trouble accessing the assignment, your first port of call should be the student computer helpdesk to find out why that is (you are probably also going to have trouble handing in the assignment if you do not get this sorted out). For this week only, here are the questions.\n2024-09-19 15:30: I just took a look through the Assignment 0’s. If you got a 1 and a “yep”, you are all good. Most people got both of those. If you handed in something and didn’t get a 1, or got a 1 and a comment, you need to figure out what happened. The commonest things missing were the embed-resources: true thing that meant that there were no graphs, and the df-print: paged thing that meant that there was no nice display of dataframes. See question 13 in worksheet 1; these go in the “YAML block” at the very top of your document. If you got a 0, you are welcome to try again and I will endeavour to take a look at your revised version. (I was pretty relaxed about what you included; if you had some code, some output and a graph, ideally with some text of your own, I was good with it.)\n2024-09-19 10:35: two things:\n\nAssignment 1 is now open, due next Monday.\nSeptember 16 was the last day to register yourself in a tutorial. If you haven’t done so yet, you will now need to go through the Registrar’s office to do this.\n\n2024-09-19 00:15: before I go to bed, my solutions to Worksheet 2.\n2024-09-18 12:00: We have a date for the midterm. I don’t want to share the time and place in public, so I am about to post an announcement on Quercus so that you can make plans.\n2024-09-16 12:55: Assignment 1 is now on Quercus, and will open for you on Wed night. Note that it is available until Wed of next week, but it is due on Monday night, and there is a late penalty (1% per hour) if you submit it after 11:59pm Monday. If you have an official Accessibility accommodation that grants you an extension on assignments, it is up to you to claim it (by emailing me) before the official due date each time you need it. The maximum such extension is two days, since I will be publishing solutions for everyone after that. There are no other extensions or make-ups, as per the syllabus. You may hand in your assignment up to two days late, but the late penalty will apply. (You will recall from your reading of the syllabus that the worst two assignments are dropped; if life circumstances intervene and you cannot hand in an assignment before it closes, that will automatically count as one of your dropped assignments.)\n2024-09-16 12:15: Monday update:\n\nlectures: the rest of numerical summaries (Tuesday), choosing things from dataframes (both days), one-sample \\(t\\) (start Thursday).\ntutorial: worksheet 2. Note that this week (and from here forward) this only has the questions. The idea is that by learning how to do the worksheet yourself (using your lecture notes and your brain), you are also learning how to do the assignment that depends on this worksheet (and thereby preparing yourself for any midterm questions on the material in this worksheet). After you have made an honest effort on this worksheet yourself, feel free to ask your tutorial TA for guidance if you get stuck. I will post my solutions on Wed evening.\nassignment 1 will be posted on Wednesday evening, after all the tutorials are done and I have posted my worksheet solutions, and will be due the following Monday night (at the traditional time of 11:59pm). The idea is that you do the assignment yourself, based on what you have learned from doing the worksheet (and from the material in your lecture notes and by using your brain); expect minimal help from me. You have practiced the submission procedure on worksheet 1 (“assignment 0”), so you should be able to figure that out for Assignment 1.\n\n2024-09-11 18:00: to answer the question from lecture: if you’re reading in data from an Excel sheet, can you get hold of the names of the sheets in R, so that you can figure out which one contains the data you want? The answer turns out to be yes. To use the test2.xlsx from lecture:\n\n\nlibrary(readxl)\nbook &lt;- \"test2.xlsx\"\nexcel_sheets(book)\n\n[1] \"data\"  \"notes\"\n\n\nand hence\n\nxy &lt;- read_excel(book, \"data\")\nxy\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  id        x     y group\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n1 p1       10    21 upper\n2 p2       11    20 lower\n3 p3       13    25 upper\n4 p4       15    27 lower\n5 p5       16    30 upper\n6 p6       17    31 lower\n\n\nCoding tip: I knew I was going to be referring to the spreadsheet file twice (once to get the names of the sheets in it, and once to access the sheet I wanted), so I saved the filename (in book, short for “workbook”) to avoid typing the filename twice. (I also gave the dataframe a name that says at least something about what it contains, even though we don’t know what x and y actually are.)\n\n2024-09-09 13:20: on the table for this week:\n\nlectures:\n\nthe rest of reading files (Tuesday, to start)\nmaking graphs (Tuesday)\nnumerical summaries (Thursday)\nchoosing things from dataframes (possibly Thursday, possibly next week)\n\ntutorials: start this week, on Wednesday. Your chance to work through (or finish working through) Worksheet 1 with a TA there to help, as well as handing in the practice Assignment 0 (checking that your graphs successfully made it).\n\n2024-09-06 13:00: I thought I would write out my plans for the course and share them with you (Google sheet):\n\nI went about as far as reading week, because I am usually too ambitious. Expect there to be edits material-wise.\nThere is a midterm to be scheduled; I try not to have an assignment and a midterm the same week (eg. if the midterm is on a Friday, there won’t be an assignment due the Monday after).\nThis means that the last assignment will probably end up being due on Nov 25 and not as shown. Expect that the material in assignment \\(n\\) will be the same as on worksheet \\(n+1\\) (the questions will of course be different), at least up until the midterm when things might get further out of sync.\nDepending on when the midterm is scheduled, the last tutorial before it might be a chance for you to bring exam-related questions to the TA.\nI made assignment 4 due the day after Thanksgiving rather than Thanksgiving itself.\n\n2024-09-05 10:20: Today’s class: reading in data. Files for today’s class (added after: it looks as if they all work now):\n\nTest 1 (xlsx)\nTest 1 (csv)\nCoffee cups\nMigraine data\nTest 2 (xlsx)\n\n2024-09-04 17:30: I think I forgot to mention exams in my go-through of the course outline on Tuesday. The information you need is on the Assessment page of the course outline, at the bottom (you might need to scroll down).\n2024-09-03 12:50: Worksheet 1, for tutorial next week, in case you want to start on it now.\n2024-09-03 11:30: There were three fourth-year students on the waitlist this morning, and I have asked for them to be added to the course. Otherwise, the course is full because the classrooms for both lecture sections are full.\n2024-08-29 14:30: there is indeed a fourth tutorial:\n\nSince there has been some last-minute reorganization, tutorials start in week 2 this year. This means that some of the early worksheets (and therefore assignments) will be a bit behind what appears in the lectures, but we will catch up as we go. The first worksheet should actually be doable after the very first lecture, so I will make sure it’s up in case you want to start on it right away. It looks as if there will be eight assignments this year (the first one will be due after week 3), of which the best six will count.\nIf you are still on the waitlist, it’s up to you to register yourself for the new LEC02. Also, if you are in LEC01 but would rather be in LEC02, you should be able to move to that section.\n\n2024-08-28 14:20: there will soon be a fourth tutorial (on Wednesday in BV 498, like the others, is the plan). It doesn’t matter which lecture section you are in; the tutorials are all good for both sections.\n2024-08-27 11:40: we have a second lecture section, and there should be space in it for everyone on the waitlist as of right now:\n\nthe lectures for LEC02 (taught by me as well) are Tu 15:00-16:00 and Th 17:00-18:00\nif you are currently on the waitlist, you can sign up for LEC02 right away\nthere will be tutorial space for everyone on Wed (it doesn’t matter which tutorial you are in, because the two lecture sections will run in parallel). Expect a fourth tutorial to be created soon. You have (I think) the option to switch tutorials, up to a certain date. Since things are in a chaotic state right now, I may switch the tutorials back to starting in week 2 (and not what I said on August 12).\nAcorn will tell you the locations of everything.\nThe times for LEC01 are unchanged.\nif you are currently in LEC01 and want to switch to LEC02, you can do that, which would allow people on the waitlist/in LEC02 to switch to LEC01 if that suits them better.\n\n2024-08-23 15:45: breaking news: we are seeing whether we can open a second section of this course. This is contingent on being able to find a classroom to hold it in at a time that those of you on the waitlist (and I) can manage, which (as is usually the case at UTSC) is the biggest part of the problem. Expect more news early next week. (If need be, we will also hold a second section of STAD29, so there will be room in any case in that course for everyone that makes it through STAC32.)\n2024-08-12 12:00:\n\nA reminder that the course is full because the lecture room is full, and so I cannot admit any more students even if I wanted to.\nThe course outline, so that you can get a sense of what to expect.\nHighlights:\n\nlectures on Tuesday and Thursday (1 hour each)\ntutorial on Wednesday in a computer lab, starting in week 1. In tutorial, you get a worksheet to work through using R with TA help if you get stuck. The first worksheet takes you through things from the very beginning and comes with answers, including a practice assignment hand-in. Later worksheets don’t come with answers (so you have to work it out yourself), but I will publish answers after each week’s tutorials are done.\ntutorial worksheets prepare you for the assignments.\nassignments are due weekly on Mondays and open the previous Wednesday night (the first one opens in week 2 and is due the Monday of week 3), on the same material that the previous worksheet was on. Your assignment answers will need to show code, output, and explanation of the results. (The practice assignment shows you what is needed.) I publish complete solutions after each assignment has been handed in.\nif you do your own work on the worksheets, this will help you for the assignments; if you do your own work on the assignments, this will help you on the exams and will thus help your course grade.\nthere will be one out-of-class midterm on a date to be announced, around halfway through the course.\nthere will be a final exam, also on a date to be announced, during the final exam period.\nexams are handwritten with short-answer questions, some of which may ask you to write code. Exams are open-book, but bear in mind that you need to organize what you bring, or else you will run out of time trying to find things.\nthe course materials (and your brain) will contain everything you need to succeed in this course, except for a few places where I ask you to find something out.\n\n\n2024-07-29 10:45:\n\nI have found space for a few more students in the course, and have asked for these students to be added. Once this is done, the course will be full, since we will be at maximum capacity for our lecture room and I am not allowed to enlarge the class any further.\nIn the next couple of days, you will see either that you have been enrolled in the course or that you have moved up the waitlist. A warning that the waitlist in this class historically moves very slowly, so if you are still on the waitlist after this, I advise you to make backup plans for your courses.\nThe waitlist is long, so I had to make some choices about who to admit. Since STAC32 and STAD29 are two of the last courses in the Statistics Applied Minor program, I prioritized those students in the program who are closest to graduating, on the basis that this may be their last year, whereas students who are further from graduating can take these courses next year. This is based on the number of credits that each student will have completed by the end of the summer (assuming they pass any summer courses), with the students on the waitlist ranked from greatest to least. If you are in your 3rd year of study (as determined by UTSC), you need to be very close to the 14.0 credits that will make you 4th year to get in this time (if you don’t, you will have a higher priority next year).\nYou can find your total number of credits in your Degree Explorer: under Degree and Completed Credits you will see something like 17.00/20.00 (includes 7.00 In Progress). This student will have 17.0 credits once they have completed the courses they are now enrolled in, and thus they have \\(17-7 = 10\\) credits completed now and are in their 3rd year of study.\nMy decision of students to enrol is final and is not open to appeal, and, as I say, the course is full once these students are enrolled because the lecture room is full.\n\n2024-06-28 19:00: time to open things up for the fall 2024 edition of this course:\n\nI’m aware that the course is filling up fast. After the 3rd years have had a chance to enrol, I will look more carefully at who is on the waitlist, with the aim of making sure that those who really need the course are able to take it, subject to space being available. My priority order is: students in the Statistics Applied Minor program, and within those, students in the fourth year of study (or beyond) as calculated by UTSC, then students in earlier years of study in the program, and then students in other programs. Appealing directly to me will not change that.\nThere are (COVID-era old) recordings of the lecture material. Things have changed since they were made, but they will be available in case you must miss an occasional lecture (for example, you are sick). They are not a substitute for routinely missing lecture; if you do that, you risk missing important material and thereby hurting your grade.\nI will be checking prerequisites. To take STAC32, you must have completed (by the time STAC32 starts in September) either STAB27 or PSYC08 or MGEB12. If you have not completed one of these courses by then, you will be removed from STAC32.\nLooking ahead to next winter’s STAD29: my aim is to make sure that there will be enough space in that course for everyone that wants to take it (and has completed STAC32).\nProgram FAQ.",

    "text": "bad picture\n\n\nWelcome to the home page for STAC33. This is the place to look for all things course-related (notes, announcements etc.) except for assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on Quercus.\nIn this course, we learn R, and how to use this software for data organization and to apply statistical methods that you (mostly) already know. I emphasize the communication of the results. That is to say, you need to get the answers, but you also need to be able to explain to others what the results mean, and convince others why what you have done is sensible. This is what a real-world data analyst does, and so you will need to demonstrate an ability to do that as well.\n\n\n\n\n2024-04-26 13:20: grades are on their way to you, “within two business days”, I am told.\n2024-04-25 22:45: marking is 100% done and grades are submitted (and are thus now final).\n2024-04-24 23:15: 95% done right now. All that’s left is the last two parts of question 6.\n2024-04-23 22:55: the end is near: 78% done. Remaining is a bit of question 2, a bit of question 3, and question 6. Grades on about Thursday seems about right.\n2024-04-22 23:10: 46% done as of tonight.\n2024-04-21 23:10: as of right now, we are 37% done. There are a couple of parts marked for most of the questions (all five TAs are hard at work).\n2024-04-20 22:55: progress report: 20% done. I finished my share of the marking, spending an eternity marking 7(a) for which there were a thousand and one ways to get it right (or not). There are smatterings of progress on most of the questions, as most of the graders have started their work.\n2024-04-19 21:55: the final exam has been scanned, and marking has begun. We are now at 11% done, which I think is mostly me so far. My solutions, with the Figures at the back if you need them.\n2024-04-12 15:45:\n\npre-exam office hours on Monday from 11:00am to about 1:00pm, depending how busy things are.\nfinal exam rules are the same as for the midterm (see note on 2024-02-22 12:05).\nthank you to the student who alerted me to a missing video (the second part of Bayesian analysis). This is now on the Quercus video page, numbered as “lecture 12b” (we didn’t do lecture 12c this time).\n\n2024-04-09 15:30: I think your final exam is done. For those interested: it has 8 questions with a total of 37 parts worth a total of 92 points. Some of it you will need to write code for; some of it will be written explanations.\n2024-04-04 21:00: there is now a Worksheet 11 on Stan. I don’t think this will run on r.datatools, so you’ll need to be running this on R on your own machine. Reminder that there are no tutorials on Monday (Monday is a makeup day for classes that missed a day on Good Friday).\n2024-04-04 15:10: the Stan code that I used in class. These may well download to your hard disk, and then you can do what you want with them:\n\nPoisson 1\nPoisson 2\nJumping rats\n\n2024-04-02 15:05: I got done in by having an old version of Stan. (Thanks to the student who alerted me to this.) The code that I gave you (for estimating the \\(\\lambda\\) of a Poisson distribution) no longer compiles, because the way you declare arrays in Stan has changed. In what I called poisson1.stan, in the data section, remove\n\nint x[8];\nand replace it with\narray[8] int x;\nThe new form of array declaration is the special word array, with the size of the array in square brackets after it (no space), then the type of elements in the array (here int or integer), then finally the name of the array. Likewise, in the second version of the Poisson example, you need array[n] int x; instead of int x[n];. There are also some changes to the ANOVA example (that we will see in class on Thursday); by the time you read this, the lecture notes will have updated to reflect the changes (there are a couple) that you will need to make from my original notes.\nI now have a properly updated version of all the parts to Stan.\n\n2024-04-01 12:00: the last (I think) Monday update for the semester:\n\nAssignments 6 and 8 are graded, and I will post the marks shortly. Appeals by usual process between Apr 4 and 9.\nLectures this week:\n\nfinish off the Functions stuff (we are near the end)\nBayesian statistics with Stan\n\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapters 22 and 25. (If you find yourself wanting to do vector and matrix algebra in R for other courses, the notes here should be easy enough to follow, but you don’t need that for this course. Likewise, if you want to learn more about the bootstrap, there is more material in the lecture notes that we won’t have time to cover in the course this time around.)\nI plan to put together a worksheet 11 on this week’s material. Look out for that later in the week.\n\n2024-03-28 21:00: it looks like we have a worksheet 10 for the final tutorial on Monday.\n2024-03-28 12:00: Assignment 7 has been marked. Appeals by usual procedure between Mar 31 and Apr 7. I forgot to ask someone to mark Assignment 6; that is now in progress.\n2024-03-27 12:50: ok, a Wednesday update instead:\n\nAssignment 8 was due on Sunday and closed yesterday night. My solutions. We are now done with assignments.\nLectures this week:\n\nTuesday: finish the asphalt case study plus regression with categorical variables (done)\nThursday: functions.\n\nExtra practice problems: there will be a worksheet on this stuff for next week, also PASIAS chapters 19, 20, and 22. (PASIAS also has material on dates and times, which we won’t do in this course.)\n\n2024-03-22 12:45: worksheet 9 for tutorial on Monday. The third question is on multiple regression; some of the things in it we sped through on Thursday or will not see until Tuesday next week.\n2024-03-21 15:20: for those interested, the actual Box-Cox formula says that you replace the response \\(y\\) by \\((y^\\lambda - 1)/\\lambda\\). This introduces \\(\\lambda\\) as an extra parameter, which you can estimate by maximum likelihood. The graph that we saw in lecture today is of the (profile) log-likelihood as a function of \\(\\lambda\\). If \\(\\lambda \\ne 0\\), it is a linear function of \\(y^\\lambda\\), but as \\(\\lambda \\rightarrow 0\\), \\((y^\\lambda - 1)/\\lambda \\rightarrow \\ln y\\). To see this, write \\(y^\\lambda = e^{\\lambda \\; \\ln y}\\). Remember that \\(y\\) is fixed here; think of the Box-Cox transformation as a function of \\(\\lambda\\). As \\(\\lambda\\) heads for zero, the limit becomes \\(0/0\\), so use L’Hôpital’s rule to show that the limit is \\(\\ln y\\).\n2024-03-18 11:00: Monday update:\n\nTutorial today, featuring Worksheet 8.\nAssignment 7 was due last night. Assignment 8 opens tonight and is due next Sunday night.\nLectures this week are on regression, starting with the windmill case study on Tuesday.\n\n2024-03-15 12:45:\n\nWorksheet 8 for tutorial on Monday. This will prepare you for Assignment 8, which opens on Monday night.\nAssignment 8 is the last assignment, but I will make worksheets the rest of the way, and there will be tutorials on the remaining Mondays. This is to help you get prepared for the final exam, which will definitely include some things that didn’t make it onto assignments (examples: the regression stuff we do next week, writing functions, Bayesian analysis, and anything else we get to).\n\n2024-03-13 11:20: my solutions to assignment 6.\n2024-03-12 11:00: Power went out here (on campus) for a few minutes, but is now back, whether from actual hydro or from a generator, I don’t know. So class goes ahead, as far as I know.\n2024-03-11 11:00: Monday update:\nThe midterm is marked. Stats: Q1 51.25 (76%), median 56 (83%), Q3 60 (89%). I will be sharing the marks and the marked midterms shortly. The marks will be on Quercus, and you will be receiving an email from Crowdmark with instructions to see your marked exam.\nAppeals are the same procedure as for assignments, between Mar 14 and Mar 21 inclusive. Do not expect me to overrule the grader’s judgment; thus, the only thing worth appealing is an actual grading error, such as an answer where the grader didn’t mark something relevant that you wrote, after consideration of my solutions and any comments on your exam. If you have not received full marks on a question part, you should have received a comment on your exam, or it should be obvious from my solutions what is missing or in error, or both of those things. Your appeal must include a clear description of the grading error (not grading judgment). If you appeal a grading judgment, you run the risk that I regrade your whole exam and your mark may go down as well as up. My philosophy on appeals is similar to that of Jeff Rosenthal.\nTutorials are happening today; worksheet 7. If you run out of time, as you probably will, you can leave the last question (the home prices data) until next week. - Assignment 6 was due last night. A reminder that there are no extensions, as stated in the course outline; you have the option of handing the assignment in before Tuesday night and taking the late penalty, or of counting it as one of your two worst assignments (or both). It is up to you to manage your time. - Assignment 7 opens tonight. - Lectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of tidying data (there are two other small sections of notes, “tidying extras” and “when pivot-wider goes wrong”).\nThursday: the first case study, on simple regression.\n\n2024-03-09 21:30: the end is in sight: the midterm is now 90% marked. I had a totally thrilling day getting the marking done that I assigned to myself on this exam, and I am now done. I’m not sure I shared my solutions, which are updated with extra comments on the bits that I marked.\n2024-03-08 21:15: two updates:\nthe midterm is now 62% marked. I spent today working on my other midterm, but tomorrow I plan to get to my marking on this one. The TAs are most of the way through their shares of the marking.\nthere is tutorial on Monday, in which you’ll be working on this worksheet, which will prepare you for Assignment 7 (that opens on Monday night).\n2024-03-07 22:15: a little bit of progress today: we are now at 33% done. I have been focusing on my other midterm, which I gave myself more of to mark.\n2024-03-06 23:00: the midterms are scanned and marking is underway. We are at 29% done.\n2024-03-05 13:30: the blog post about Tukey’s method that I mentioned in lecture, if you want more background.\n2024-03-04 11:00: Monday update:\nthere is no TA strike. Last night, the university and the TA union came to a “tentative agreement”, which the TAs still have to vote on (so we are not safe yet), but for now there is no strike.\non the midterm, questions 2(f) and 2(g) were impossible to answer with the information I gave you, so I have removed them from the exam (which is now out of 67 points).\nexam marking will begin once the exams have been scanned and uploaded to Crowdmark.\nreminder that there are no tutorials today. If you have not yet worked through worksheet 6, now would be a good time to do so, in preparation for Assignment 6 (which is due next Sunday night).\nlectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of analysis of variance\nThursday: tidying data - extra practice problems in PASIAS: chapter 13 (analysis of variance), chapter 17 (tidying data). The intervening chapters are on writing reports, on which there is lecture material, but I won’t be talking about that this time.\n\n2024-03-01 12:20:\n\nmy solutions to Assignment 5\nif you have to miss the midterm, the weight goes automatically onto the final exam. Complete an absence declaration so that there is a record. (added 2024-03-03 20:30: if you already used your absence declaration, I do not need to see any additional documentation, but any other professors affected by your absence might, so be prepared.)\nconversely, if your final exam is better than your midterm, the final exam counts instead of your midterm.\nthere will be no tutorials on Monday (regardless of whether the TAs are on strike) because if the TAs are working, they will be marking your midterm.\n\n2024-02-26 11:35: Monday update:\n\nMidterm time and location is on an announcement on Quercus labelled Midterm. See the notes from Feb 20 and 22 for course coverage and exam procedures.\nAssignment 5 was due last night. Assignment 6 opens tonight; you have two weeks to complete this (so that it is not due the same weekend as the midterm), but the material on it is on the midterm, so you would do well to work on it as part of your preparation.\nTutorial today, where you have the chance to ask subject-matter questions of your TAs as well as work on worksheet 6, which will prepare you for Assignment 6, which will help you prepare for the midterm.\nSee the Feb 20 note for what is on the midterm.\nLectures this week:\n\nTuesday: matched pairs sign test, Mood median test\nThursday: analysis of variance\n\nExtra practice problems in PASIAS (the chapters get out of order here):\n\nChapter 12: normal quantile plots\nChapter 11: matched pairs\nChapter 10: Mood’s median test\nChapter 13: analysis of variance.\n\nif you have questions as you prepare for the midterm, post them on the Quercus discussion board or catch me after lecture.\n\n2024-02-22 21:00: one more thing today: Worksheet 6, for tutorial on Monday. If you have subject-matter questions about the material on the exam, you can also ask your TA about those on Monday. If you have administrative questions about the exam that are not answered elsewhere, put them on the Quercus discussion board.\n2024-02-22 12:05:\n\nthe midterm is open-book. You can bring what you wish, such as your lecture notes, assignments, my slides, assignment solutions, etc, printed (no computers or other devices at the exam). You will need to organize whatever you bring, so that you can quickly find what you are looking for (and so there is an upper limit on what there is any point in bringing). If you are not well prepared, you can expect to run out of time; you will not have time to look everything up or go searching for things.\nthe exam is on its way to be printed. There are 6 questions, with a total of 30 parts worth 73 points altogether (the parts are typically worth 2 or 3 points and are about as much work as you would do on an assignment for 2 or 3 points). Expect to be writing code and explanations (for example, I might ask for code to do a task, or give you code or output and ask questions about it).\nat the exam, you will of course get an exam paper with spaces to write your answers, but you also get a booklet with numbered Figures to refer to during the exam. The exam will say things like “In Figure 10, what is…” and you will need to find Figure 10 in the other booklet.\nthis is a Crowdmark exam, so it is best to use a pen or a sharp pencil, otherwise we may have trouble reading your answers.\nlooking ahead to next week, there will be a tutorial on Monday for which there will be a worksheet (on the material from last week), and there will be lectures on Tuesday and Thursday on new material. This lecture material will not be on the midterm, but you can count on it being on the final exam, and it will help you understand what follows in the course.\n\n2024-02-20 13:40 (edit 14:05): ok, so there is a Tuesday update instead:\n\nAssignments 3 and 4 are graded, and I will post the marks in a moment. Appeals by the usual procedure, between Feb 23 and Mar 1 (for both). There was some work that was rather obviously AI-generated; I will decide whether I want to pursue academic integrity violations on any of it. A reminder that the sorts of things I ask you to do yourself on assignments are the same sorts of things you will need to do yourself on the exams, so by using anything other than your own brain and the course materials on the assignments, you are setting yourself up for failure on the exams.\nAssignment 3 appears to be graded; I will post the marks once I have confirmation from the grader. (edit: it has been graded.)\nCoverage for the midterm is what we did in lecture before reading week, up to and including the “cliffhanger” (that is to say, the matched pairs \\(t\\)-test).\n\n2024-02-18 22:15: A Sunday night “Monday update” to remind you that this upcoming week is Reading Week, so there are no tutorials tomorrow or lectures on Tuesday or Thursday. We resume on the 26th.\n2024-02-15 13:30: in what seems like a repeat of previous announcements, it is snowing, but I am here and campus is open, so class goes ahead. Today, normal quantile plots and however much of matched pairs we get to.\n2024-02-14 13:30: My solutions to Assignment 4.\n2024-02-12 10:50: Monday update:\n\ntutorials today; the worksheet.\nassignments:\n\nAssignment 2 is graded; I will release the marks shortly. Appeals by the same procedure as Assignment 1 between Feb 15 and Feb 22.\nAssignment 3 is almost graded.\nAssignment 4 was due last night. Reminders: the late penalty is 1% per hour; if you are a few minutes late, you will lose 1%, and it is not worth your time or mine to quibble about that. Also, a complete submission is the rendered version of your Quarto document; if your document does not render, it is up to you to find out why and to fix it.\nAssignment 5 opens tonight. You have two weeks to do this one (it is due on Sunday night at the end of reading week).\n\nlectures: I think I am done with power of hypothesis tests. There are some more examples in the lecture notes, which you can read if you want to gain some extra understanding.\n\nTuesday: sign test\nThursday: normal quantile plot, matched pairs\n\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 8 (power and sample size), 9 (sign test), 11 (matched pairs), 12 (normal quantile plots).\n\n2024-02-08 12:00: Worksheet 5 for Monday’s tutorial.\n2024-02-08 10:50: my solutions to Assignment 3.\n2024-02-06 11:30: On assignment 4, question 2, I was a little bit eager on the delete key! I just put back the actual question and the link to the data file, so that you now know what you were supposed to be doing. Re-download the questions from Quercus if you need to.\n2024-02-05 15:15: assignment planning: there will be no assignments due during reading week or the weekend of the midterm. That means you’ll get two weeks to do each of Assignment 5 (due the Sunday night at the end of reading week) and Assignment 6 (due March 10). The eighth and final assignment will be due on March 24, so you’ll get a break at the end of the course.\n2024-02-05 11:45: Monday update:\n\nTutorials happening today as usual; see the note three days ago for the worksheet.\nAssignments: there will be a delay in marking assignment #2 (which is my fault), but I now have graders for #2 and #3. #3 was due yesterday, but remains open until Tuesday with late penalty. #4 opens tonight.\nLectures:\n\nTuesday: the rest of the bootstrap stuff, including the code that we skipped last week.\nThursday: power of hypothesis tests. In with both of those is a procedure for how you might do simulations in general. My take is that statistical theory will only take you so far; you will run into places where the math is beyond you and simulation is the only way to understand what is happening.\n\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 8 for power. For examples of bootstrap distribution of sample mean, look in the Extras to the problems in chapters 6 and 7.\n\n2024-02-02 12:45: Worksheet 4, for tutorial on Monday.\n2024-02-01 10:30: My solutions to Assignment 2.\n2024-01-30 13:45: I was sure I had posted my solutions to assignment 1, but they seemed to have disappeared. Click the link just above to see them.\n2024-01-29 13:15: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 1 has been graded (see below for appeal procedure)\nAssignment 2 was due last night and is open (with late penalty) until Tuesday night\nAssignment 3 opens tonight, and is due next Sunday night.\nTutorials are happening today as usual; you’ll be working on worksheet 3.\nIn lectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of one-sample inference\nThursday: two-sample inference (which is a bit more complicated than you learned in B57). I might get into the bootstrap sampling distribution of the sample mean this week, or it might be next week.\n\nPractice problems for this week’s material: chapters 6 and 7 of PASIAS.\n\n2024-01-29 11:00: Assignment 1 has been graded, and I am about to post the marks.\n\nIf you wish to appeal your mark, first read sections 3.19 through 3.23 of the detailed course policies. For your appeal to be successful, you will need to demonstrate an error in the grading: that is to say, you will need to demonstrate that your work was actually correct despite not receiving full marks. Read carefully the last sentence of 3.19 as well as the whole of 3.20 in the detailed course policies. You are also warned that I have the right to regrade your entire assignment, and so your mark can go down as well as up.\nTo appeal your mark on an assignment, write me an email with the word “appeal”, the course code, and the assignment number in the subject line, for assignment 1 between February 2 and February 9 inclusive, in which you explain how there was an error in the grading of your assignment: that is to say, the grader missed something you wrote that was completely correct according to my solutions or that you argue also was a complete answer to the question. This also includes such things as addition errors in your assignment mark.\n\n2024-01-26 12:00: Worksheet 3 for tutorial on Monday. (Edit 2024-01-27 20:20: thanks to the eagle eyes of one of your TAs, a typo has been corrected.)\n2024-01-24 23:30: if you seem to be unable to create new Quarto documents, this is probably because you are running an old version of R Studio on your own computer. You can check what version you are currently running by selecting Help and About R Studio. Mine is 2023.12.0. Versions 2022.07.1 and newer include Quarto in them (including the ability to create new Quarto documents). If yours is older than that, now is a good time to upgrade.\n2024-01-24 11:25: We have a midterm date. See the announcement on Quercus for date, time, and place.\n2024-01-23 11:30: hint for one of the parts of Assignment 2: geom_line joins neighbouring points on a graph with a line.\n2024-01-22 13:40: this week:\n\nAssignment 1 was due last night, and remains open until Tuesday with late penalty.\ntutorial today, to work through Worksheet 2.\nAssignment 2, on the same material as worksheet 2, opens tonight and is due next Sunday night.\nin lectures this week:\n\nChoosing things from dataframes (this is a lot, but it goes fast)\nthe first part of statistical inference.\n\nMore practice problems: chapters 1 through about 6 of PASIAS.\n\n2024-01-18 22:00: I just took a look through the assignment 0’s that were handed in:\n\nIf you seemed to have done the right thing and I could see it including your graph, you should have 1 mark (out of 1). If you handed something in and for some reason it didn’t work, you’ll have a mark of zero plus a comment. Mostly this was that I couldn’t see your graph. If that happened to you, figure out how to fix it before you hand in assignment 1. (Hint: did you include the “embed-resources” thing described in 2(j) on Worksheet 1? If you had re-downloaded the file you handed in, you would have been able to see that your graph did not make it.)\nYou can have as many attempts at Assignment 0 as you wish. If you didn’t get it the first time, I encourage you to have another go. I intend to take a look in the next day or two at any more that are handed in since I looked just now.\nMy past experience is that most of the people who have trouble handing in Assignment 1 properly did not even attempt assignment 0. You have a free chance here to make sure that you understand the procedure.\n\n2024-01-18 15:30:\n\nWorksheet 2, on this week’s material, for tutorial on Monday.\nThe waitlist for this course is now closed. The course is full, so I will not enrol any extra people in the class (and bear in mind that everyone on the waitlist wanted to get into the course, so your reasons for getting in are not special). If you didn’t make it this year, you are welcome to try again next year, but be aware that you will need to register as early as possible. I try to save some places for 4th years (by UTSC’s definition: 14 or more credits).\n\n2024-01-15 11:00: On the agenda this week:\n\nAssignment 1, on the stuff you are doing on the worksheet today, will open tonight and be due next Sunday night (the 21st).\nLectures:\n\nmaking graphs (Tuesday)\nnumerical summaries, choosing things from dataframes (start) (Thursday)\n\nnext week’s tutorial (on Monday, a week from today) will feature a worksheet on the things in this week’s lectures.\nAssignment 2 (opening Monday next week) will also be on those things.\n\n2024-01-15 09:30: reminder: your tutorial is today, for practice on Worksheet 1 and handing in “Assignment 0” (the first “real assignment” will be due next week).\n2024-01-11 15:15:\n\nWorksheet 1, for practice on this week’s material.\nThe two datafiles I forgot earlier: coffee.txt, migraine.txt. You should be able to find course datafiles at a URL like http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/filename.txt where you replace filename.txt by whatever the file is called.\n\n2024-01-11 11:45: looking out of my office window, I might as well repeat Tuesday’s announcement!\n\nafter today’s lecture, I will post Worksheet 1, which gives you a chance to work through some of the stuff we’ve seen so far. You can work through it during tutorial, or before (and bring any problems or confusions to tutorial).\nAssignment 1 will open after Monday’s tutorial, and will be due the following Sunday night (Jan 21). Expect the same structure each week: working through the worksheet, with help available in tutorial, will prepare you for the next assignment, and doing the assignments (yourself!) will prepare you for the exams.\nData files for today’s lecture: test1.xls, test1.csv, test2.xls\n\n2024-01-09 10:40: campus is open, I am here, and the weather looks worse than it actually is, so class goes ahead today. On the agenda for this week:\n\ntoday: course outline and running R\nThursday: reading data from files.\n\n2024-01-08 12:25: first lecture is tomorrow; your ACORN has the location. Here is a short description of how things will go:\n\nTwo one-hour lectures a week, Tuesday and Thursday. I will have office hours after each lecture, or you can talk with me at the end of lecture, or you can post in the Quercus discussions for the course.\nYou should be registered in one of the three tutorials (on Mondays, starting next week, in week 2 of classes).\nIn tutorial, you will get a worksheet to work through yourself (with my answers and extra discussion). There will be at least one TA in attendance. Ask for help if you get stuck or confused.\nThere will be weekly assignments, with the first one opening on January 15 after tutorial (and due the following Sunday night). There will be about eight assignments altogether, with no assignments due during reading week or around the midterm.\nEach item helps you with the next on the list: doing the worksheet will help you with the corresponding assignment, and doing the assignments will help you with the exams.\nThe first part of the lecture notes contains the course outline. Read this now, to get a more detailed idea of what to expect.\n\n2024-01-03 11:10: lecture 1 is just under a week away. I am assuming that you are completely familiar with basic statistical techniques, such as:\n\nwhat graphs are available to you for each kind of data, and how to interpret them\nwhat a hypothesis test does and does not do\ntests for one and two and more than two means (\\(t\\)-tests for the first two and ANOVA for the third)\nhow to apply all of these to data and to interpret the results\nbasic probability distributions\nwe will learn how to do all of the above in R (I assume you know nothing about R).\n\nThere is very little actual math in this course, but there are a lot of ideas, and there is a lot of explanation of those ideas as they apply to data. Thus, you need to understand the theory that you have learned, but you also need to know how it applies to the data in front of you.\nIf you have learned some R before, you may see that I do things differently from what you learned before. I am expecting you to do things in this course as I teach them. All the work in this course can be done using ideas from this course, except where I say otherwise.\n2023-12-14 14:05: I found room for a few more students, 4th years in either our Major or Specialist programs. I know there are not very many C or D level courses in the winter semester, so these seemed to be the people whose need was greatest.\n2023-12-12 16:30: I’ve been doing some planning for this course. Here’s what to expect:\n\nlectures Tuesday and Thursday (1 hour each)\ntutorial Monday, in a computer lab, in which you will get a worksheet to work through on the material from the previous week’s lecture, with a TA or two around to help if you get stuck or confused. Tutorials start in week 2.\nweekly assignments open on Monday night, on the same material as the worksheet you just did, and are due the following Sunday night. The first assignment will open in week 2.\nthere will be about 8 assignments.\na midterm (2 hours) and a final exam (3 hours) as usual, on dates to be announced. I will move any assignments with due dates close to the midterm, as needed. My exams are always open book.\nthe worksheets will help you with the assignments, and the assignments will help you with the exams, provided you do them yourself.\n\n2023-08-10 13:30: I have asked to add some students to the course. These are all UTSC students, 4th years who joined the waitlist before August 9, and 3rd years who joined the waitlist before 10:30am on July 11. If you are still on the waitlist after this has been processed, you will have to take your chances.\n\n2024-03-15 12:45:\n\nWorksheet 8 for tutorial on Monday. This will prepare you for Assignment 8, which opens on Monday night.\nAssignment 8 is the last assignment, but I will make worksheets the rest of the way, and there will be tutorials on the remaining Mondays. This is to help you get prepared for the final exam, which will definitely include some things that didn’t make it onto assignments (examples: the regression stuff we do next week, writing functions, Bayesian analysis, and anything else we get to).\n\n2024-03-13 11:20: my solutions to assignment 6.\n2024-03-12 11:00: Power went out here (on campus) for a few minutes, but is now back, whether from actual hydro or from a generator, I don’t know. So class goes ahead, as far as I know.\n2024-03-11 11:00: Monday update:\n\nThe midterm is marked. Stats: Q1 51.25 (76%), median 56 (83%), Q3 60 (89%). I will be sharing the marks and the marked midterms shortly. The marks will be on Quercus, and you will be receiving an email from Crowdmark with instructions to see your marked exam.\n\nAppeals are the same procedure as for assignments, between Mar 14 and Mar 21 inclusive. Do not expect me to overrule the grader’s judgment; thus, the only thing worth appealing is an actual grading error, such as an answer where the grader didn’t mark something relevant that you wrote, after consideration of my solutions and any comments on your exam. If you have not received full marks on a question part, you should have received a comment on your exam, or it should be obvious from my solutions what is missing or in error, or both of those things. Your appeal must include a clear description of the grading error (not grading judgment). If you appeal a grading judgment, you run the risk that I regrade your whole exam and your mark may go down as well as up. My philosophy on appeals is similar to that of Jeff Rosenthal.\n\nTutorials are happening today; worksheet 7. If you run out of time, as you probably will, you can leave the last question (the home prices data) until next week.\nAssignment 6 was due last night. A reminder that there are no extensions, as stated in the course outline; you have the option of handing the assignment in before Tuesday night and taking the late penalty, or of counting it as one of your two worst assignments (or both). It is up to you to manage your time.\nAssignment 7 opens tonight.\nLectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of tidying data (there are two other small sections of notes, “tidying extras” and “when pivot-wider goes wrong”).\nThursday: the first case study, on simple regression.\n\n\n2024-03-09 21:30: the end is in sight: the midterm is now 90% marked. I had a totally thrilling day getting the marking done that I assigned to myself on this exam, and I am now done. I’m not sure I shared my solutions, which are updated with extra comments on the bits that I marked.\n2024-03-08 21:15: two updates:\n\nthe midterm is now 62% marked. I spent today working on my other midterm, but tomorrow I plan to get to my marking on this one. The TAs are most of the way through their shares of the marking.\nthere is tutorial on Monday, in which you’ll be working on this worksheet, which will prepare you for Assignment 7 (that opens on Monday night).\n\n2024-03-07 22:15: a little bit of progress today: we are now at 33% done. I have been focusing on my other midterm, which I gave myself more of to mark.\n2024-03-06 23:00: the midterms are scanned and marking is underway. We are at 29% done.\n2024-03-05 13:30: the blog post about Tukey’s method that I mentioned in lecture, if you want more background.\n2024-03-04 11:00: Monday update:\n\nthere is no TA strike. Last night, the university and the TA union came to a “tentative agreement”, which the TAs still have to vote on (so we are not safe yet), but for now there is no strike.\non the midterm, questions 2(f) and 2(g) were impossible to answer with the information I gave you, so I have removed them from the exam (which is now out of 67 points).\nexam marking will begin once the exams have been scanned and uploaded to Crowdmark.\nreminder that there are no tutorials today. If you have not yet worked through worksheet 6, now would be a good time to do so, in preparation for Assignment 6 (which is due next Sunday night).\nlectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of analysis of variance\nThursday: tidying data\n\nextra practice problems in PASIAS: chapter 13 (analysis of variance), chapter 17 (tidying data). The intervening chapters are on writing reports, on which there is lecture material, but I won’t be talking about that this time.\n\n2024-03-01 12:20:\n\nmy solutions to Assignment 5\nif you have to miss the midterm, the weight goes automatically onto the final exam. Complete an absence declaration so that there is a record. (added 2024-03-03 20:30: if you already used your absence declaration, I do not need to see any additional documentation, but any other professors affected by your absence might, so be prepared.)\nconversely, if your final exam is better than your midterm, the final exam counts instead of your midterm.\nthere will be no tutorials on Monday (regardless of whether the TAs are on strike) because if the TAs are working, they will be marking your midterm.\n\n2024-02-26 11:35: Monday update:\n\nMidterm time and location is on an announcement on Quercus labelled Midterm. See the notes from Feb 20 and 22 for course coverage and exam procedures.\nAssignment 5 was due last night. Assignment 6 opens tonight; you have two weeks to complete this (so that it is not due the same weekend as the midterm), but the material on it is on the midterm, so you would do well to work on it as part of your preparation.\nTutorial today, where you have the chance to ask subject-matter questions of your TAs as well as work on worksheet 6, which will prepare you for Assignment 6, which will help you prepare for the midterm.\nSee the Feb 20 note for what is on the midterm.\nLectures this week:\n\nTuesday: matched pairs sign test, Mood median test\nThursday: analysis of variance\n\nExtra practice problems in PASIAS (the chapters get out of order here):\n\nChapter 12: normal quantile plots\nChapter 11: matched pairs\nChapter 10: Mood’s median test\nChapter 13: analysis of variance.\n\nif you have questions as you prepare for the midterm, post them on the Quercus discussion board or catch me after lecture.\n\n2024-02-22 21:00: one more thing today: Worksheet 6, for tutorial on Monday. If you have subject-matter questions about the material on the exam, you can also ask your TA about those on Monday. If you have administrative questions about the exam that are not answered elsewhere, put them on the Quercus discussion board.\n2024-02-22 12:05:\n\nthe midterm is open-book. You can bring what you wish, such as your lecture notes, assignments, my slides, assignment solutions, etc, printed (no computers or other devices at the exam). You will need to organize whatever you bring, so that you can quickly find what you are looking for (and so there is an upper limit on what there is any point in bringing). If you are not well prepared, you can expect to run out of time; you will not have time to look everything up or go searching for things.\nthe exam is on its way to be printed. There are 6 questions, with a total of 30 parts worth 73 points altogether (the parts are typically worth 2 or 3 points and are about as much work as you would do on an assignment for 2 or 3 points). Expect to be writing code and explanations (for example, I might ask for code to do a task, or give you code or output and ask questions about it).\nat the exam, you will of course get an exam paper with spaces to write your answers, but you also get a booklet with numbered Figures to refer to during the exam. The exam will say things like “In Figure 10, what is…” and you will need to find Figure 10 in the other booklet.\nthis is a Crowdmark exam, so it is best to use a pen or a sharp pencil, otherwise we may have trouble reading your answers.\nlooking ahead to next week, there will be a tutorial on Monday for which there will be a worksheet (on the material from last week), and there will be lectures on Tuesday and Thursday on new material. This lecture material will not be on the midterm, but you can count on it being on the final exam, and it will help you understand what follows in the course.\n\n2024-02-20 13:40 (edit 14:05): ok, so there is a Tuesday update instead:\n\nAssignments 3 and 4 are graded, and I will post the marks in a moment. Appeals by the usual procedure, between Feb 23 and Mar 1 (for both). There was some work that was rather obviously AI-generated; I will decide whether I want to pursue academic integrity violations on any of it. A reminder that the sorts of things I ask you to do yourself on assignments are the same sorts of things you will need to do yourself on the exams, so by using anything other than your own brain and the course materials on the assignments, you are setting yourself up for failure on the exams.\nAssignment 3 appears to be graded; I will post the marks once I have confirmation from the grader. (edit: it has been graded.)\nCoverage for the midterm is what we did in lecture before reading week, up to and including the “cliffhanger” (that is to say, the matched pairs \\(t\\)-test).\n\n2024-02-18 22:15: A Sunday night “Monday update” to remind you that this upcoming week is Reading Week, so there are no tutorials tomorrow or lectures on Tuesday or Thursday. We resume on the 26th.\n2024-02-15 13:30: in what seems like a repeat of previous announcements, it is snowing, but I am here and campus is open, so class goes ahead. Today, normal quantile plots and however much of matched pairs we get to.\n2024-02-14 13:30: My solutions to Assignment 4.\n2024-02-12 10:50: Monday update:\n\ntutorials today; the worksheet.\nassignments:\n\nAssignment 2 is graded; I will release the marks shortly. Appeals by the same procedure as Assignment 1 between Feb 15 and Feb 22.\nAssignment 3 is almost graded.\nAssignment 4 was due last night. Reminders: the late penalty is 1% per hour; if you are a few minutes late, you will lose 1%, and it is not worth your time or mine to quibble about that. Also, a complete submission is the rendered version of your Quarto document; if your document does not render, it is up to you to find out why and to fix it.\nAssignment 5 opens tonight. You have two weeks to do this one (it is due on Sunday night at the end of reading week).\n\nlectures: I think I am done with power of hypothesis tests. There are some more examples in the lecture notes, which you can read if you want to gain some extra understanding.\n\nTuesday: sign test\nThursday: normal quantile plot, matched pairs\n\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 8 (power and sample size), 9 (sign test), 11 (matched pairs), 12 (normal quantile plots).\n\n2024-02-08 12:00: Worksheet 5 for Monday’s tutorial.\n2024-02-08 10:50: my solutions to Assignment 3.\n2024-02-06 11:30: On assignment 4, question 2, I was a little bit eager on the delete key! I just put back the actual question and the link to the data file, so that you now know what you were supposed to be doing. Re-download the questions from Quercus if you need to.\n2024-02-05 15:15: assignment planning: there will be no assignments due during reading week or the weekend of the midterm. That means you’ll get two weeks to do each of Assignment 5 (due the Sunday night at the end of reading week) and Assignment 6 (due March 10). The eighth and final assignment will be due on March 24, so you’ll get a break at the end of the course.\n2024-02-05 11:45: Monday update:\n\nTutorials happening today as usual; see the note three days ago for the worksheet.\nAssignments: there will be a delay in marking assignment #2 (which is my fault), but I now have graders for #2 and #3. #3 was due yesterday, but remains open until Tuesday with late penalty. #4 opens tonight.\nLectures:\n\nTuesday: the rest of the bootstrap stuff, including the code that we skipped last week.\nThursday: power of hypothesis tests. In with both of those is a procedure for how you might do simulations in general. My take is that statistical theory will only take you so far; you will run into places where the math is beyond you and simulation is the only way to understand what is happening.\n\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 8 for power. For examples of bootstrap distribution of sample mean, look in the Extras to the problems in chapters 6 and 7.\n\n2024-02-02 12:45: Worksheet 4, for tutorial on Monday.\n2024-02-01 10:30: My solutions to Assignment 2.\n2024-01-30 13:45: I was sure I had posted my solutions to assignment 1, but they seemed to have disappeared. Click the link just above to see them.\n2024-01-29 13:15: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 1 has been graded (see below for appeal procedure)\nAssignment 2 was due last night and is open (with late penalty) until Tuesday night\nAssignment 3 opens tonight, and is due next Sunday night.\nTutorials are happening today as usual; you’ll be working on worksheet 3.\nIn lectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of one-sample inference\nThursday: two-sample inference (which is a bit more complicated than you learned in B57). I might get into the bootstrap sampling distribution of the sample mean this week, or it might be next week.\n\nPractice problems for this week’s material: chapters 6 and 7 of PASIAS.\n\n2024-01-29 11:00: Assignment 1 has been graded, and I am about to post the marks.\n\nIf you wish to appeal your mark, first read sections 3.19 through 3.23 of the detailed course policies. For your appeal to be successful, you will need to demonstrate an error in the grading: that is to say, you will need to demonstrate that your work was actually correct despite not receiving full marks. Read carefully the last sentence of 3.19 as well as the whole of 3.20 in the detailed course policies. You are also warned that I have the right to regrade your entire assignment, and so your mark can go down as well as up.\nTo appeal your mark on an assignment, write me an email with the word “appeal”, the course code, and the assignment number in the subject line, for assignment 1 between February 2 and February 9 inclusive, in which you explain how there was an error in the grading of your assignment: that is to say, the grader missed something you wrote that was completely correct according to my solutions or that you argue also was a complete answer to the question. This also includes such things as addition errors in your assignment mark.\n\n2024-01-26 12:00: Worksheet 3 for tutorial on Monday. (Edit 2024-01-27 20:20: thanks to the eagle eyes of one of your TAs, a typo has been corrected.)\n2024-01-24 23:30: if you seem to be unable to create new Quarto documents, this is probably because you are running an old version of R Studio on your own computer.

I am assuming that you are completely familiar with basic statistical techniques, such as:\n\nwhat graphs are available to you for each kind of data, and how to interpret them\nwhat a hypothesis test does and does not do\ntests for one and two and more than two means (\\(t\\)-tests for the first two and ANOVA for the third)\nhow to apply all of these to data and to interpret the results\nbasic probability distributions\nwe will learn how to do all of the above in R (I assume you know nothing about R).\n\nThere is very little actual math in this course, but there are a lot of ideas, and there is a lot of explanation of those ideas as they apply to data. Thus, you need to understand the theory that you have learned, but you also need to know how it applies to the data in front of you.\nIf you have learned some R before, you may see that I do things differently from what you learned before. I am expecting you to do things in this course as I teach them. All the work in this course can be done using ideas from this course, except where I say otherwise.\n2023-12-14 14:05: I found room for a few more students, 4th years in either our Major or Specialist programs. I know there are not very many C or D level courses in the winter semester, so these seemed to be the people whose need was greatest.\n2023-12-12 16:30: I’ve been doing some planning for this course. Here’s what to expect:\n\nlectures Tuesday and Thursday (1 hour each)\ntutorial Monday, in a computer lab, in which you will get a worksheet to work through on the material from the previous week’s lecture, with a TA or two around to help if you get stuck or confused. Tutorials start in week 2.\nweekly assignments open on Monday night, on the same material as the worksheet you just did, and are due the following Sunday night. The first assignment will open in week 2.\nthere will be about 8 assignments.\na midterm (2 hours) and a final exam (3 hours) as usual, on dates to be announced. I will move any assignments with due dates close to the midterm, as needed. My exams are always open book.\nthe worksheets will help you with the assignments, and the assignments will help you with the exams, provided you do them yourself.\n\n2023-08-10 13:30: I have asked to add some students to the course. These are all UTSC students, 4th years who joined the waitlist before August 9, and 3rd years who joined the waitlist before 10:30am on July 11. If you are still on the waitlist after this has been processed, you will have to take your chances.\n2023-08-10 12:50: I am aware that the course has a longish waitlist. I have room to add a few more students. I will be prioritizing 4th years, since I know that majors/minors/specialists require a certain number of upper-level courses to complete their programs. If there is room to admit 3rd years, I will do so in the order that they joined the waitlist. This is (historically) a popular class, and it is up to you to register for it as early as possible if you want to get in. Do not appeal to me for special treatment. The choice of students to add is mine.",

This is the place to look for all things course-related (notes, announcements etc.) except for assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on Quercus.\nIn this course, we learn R, and how to use this software for data organization and to apply statistical methods that you (mostly) already know. I emphasize the communication of the results. That is to say, you need to get the answers, but you also need to be able to explain to others what the results mean, and convince others why what you have done is sensible. This is what a real-world data analyst does, and so you will need to demonstrate an ability to do that as well.",

    "text": "2024-04-26 13:20: grades are on their way to you, “within two business days”, I am told.\n2024-04-25 22:45: marking is 100% done and grades are submitted (and are thus now final).\n2024-04-24 23:15: 95% done right now. All that’s left is the last two parts of question 6.\n2024-04-23 22:55: the end is near: 78% done. Remaining is a bit of question 2, a bit of question 3, and question 6. Grades on about Thursday seems about right.\n2024-04-22 23:10: 46% done as of tonight.\n2024-04-21 23:10: as of right now, we are 37% done. There are a couple of parts marked for most of the questions (all five TAs are hard at work).\n2024-04-20 22:55: progress report: 20% done. I finished my share of the marking, spending an eternity marking 7(a) for which there were a thousand and one ways to get it right (or not). There are smatterings of progress on most of the questions, as most of the graders have started their work.\n2024-04-19 21:55: the final exam has been scanned, and marking has begun. We are now at 11% done, which I think is mostly me so far. My solutions, with the Figures at the back if you need them.\n2024-04-12 15:45:\n\npre-exam office hours on Monday from 11:00am to about 1:00pm, depending how busy things are.\nfinal exam rules are the same as for the midterm (see note on 2024-02-22 12:05).\nthank you to the student who alerted me to a missing video (the second part of Bayesian analysis). This is now on the Quercus video page, numbered as “lecture 12b” (we didn’t do lecture 12c this time).\n\n2024-04-09 15:30: I think your final exam is done. For those interested: it has 8 questions with a total of 37 parts worth a total of 92 points. Some of it you will need to write code for; some of it will be written explanations.\n2024-04-04 21:00: there is now a Worksheet 11 on Stan. I don’t think this will run on r.datatools, so you’ll need to be running this on R on your own machine. Reminder that there are no tutorials on Monday (Monday is a makeup day for classes that missed a day on Good Friday).\n2024-04-04 15:10: the Stan code that I used in class. These may well download to your hard disk, and then you can do what you want with them:\n\nPoisson 1\nPoisson 2\nJumping rats\n\n2024-04-02 15:05: I got done in by having an old version of Stan. (Thanks to the student who alerted me to this.) The code that I gave you (for estimating the \\(\\lambda\\) of a Poisson distribution) no longer compiles, because the way you declare arrays in Stan has changed. In what I called poisson1.stan, in the data section, remove\n\nint x[8];\nand replace it with\narray[8] int x;\nThe new form of array declaration is the special word array, with the size of the array in square brackets after it (no space), then the type of elements in the array (here int or integer), then finally the name of the array. Likewise, in the second version of the Poisson example, you need array[n] int x; instead of int x[n];. There are also some changes to the ANOVA example (that we will see in class on Thursday); by the time you read this, the lecture notes will have updated to reflect the changes (there are a couple) that you will need to make from my original notes.\nI now have a properly updated version of all the parts to Stan.\n\n2024-04-01 12:00: the last (I think) Monday update for the semester:\n\nAssignments 6 and 8 are graded, and I will post the marks shortly. Appeals by usual process between Apr 4 and 9.\nLectures this week:\n\nfinish off the Functions stuff (we are near the end)\nBayesian statistics with Stan\n\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapters 22 and 25. (If you find yourself wanting to do vector and matrix algebra in R for other courses, the notes here should be easy enough to follow, but you don’t need that for this course. Likewise, if you want to learn more about the bootstrap, there is more material in the lecture notes that we won’t have time to cover in the course this time around.)\nI plan to put together a worksheet 11 on this week’s material. Look out for that later in the week.\n\n2024-03-28 21:00: it looks like we have a worksheet 10 for the final tutorial on Monday.\n2024-03-28 12:00: Assignment 7 has been marked. Appeals by usual procedure between Mar 31 and Apr 7. I forgot to ask someone to mark Assignment 6; that is now in progress.\n2024-03-27 12:50: ok, a Wednesday update instead:\n\nAssignment 8 was due on Sunday and closed yesterday night. My solutions. We are now done with assignments.\nLectures this week:\n\nTuesday: finish the asphalt case study plus regression with categorical variables (done)\nThursday: functions.\n\nExtra practice problems: there will be a worksheet on this stuff for next week, also PASIAS chapters 19, 20, and 22. (PASIAS also has material on dates and times, which we won’t do in this course.)\n\n2024-03-22 12:45: worksheet 9 for tutorial on Monday. The third question is on multiple regression; some of the things in it we sped through on Thursday or will not see until Tuesday next week.\n2024-03-21 15:20: for those interested, the actual Box-Cox formula says that you replace the response \\(y\\) by \\((y^\\lambda - 1)/\\lambda\\). This introduces \\(\\lambda\\) as an extra parameter, which you can estimate by maximum likelihood. The graph that we saw in lecture today is of the (profile) log-likelihood as a function of \\(\\lambda\\). If \\(\\lambda \\ne 0\\), it is a linear function of \\(y^\\lambda\\), but as \\(\\lambda \\rightarrow 0\\), \\((y^\\lambda - 1)/\\lambda \\rightarrow \\ln y\\). To see this, write \\(y^\\lambda = e^{\\lambda \\; \\ln y}\\). Remember that \\(y\\) is fixed here; think of the Box-Cox transformation as a function of \\(\\lambda\\). As \\(\\lambda\\) heads for zero, the limit becomes \\(0/0\\), so use L’Hôpital’s rule to show that the limit is \\(\\ln y\\).\n2024-03-18 11:00: Monday update:\n\nTutorial today, featuring Worksheet 8.\nAssignment 7 was due last night. Assignment 8 opens tonight and is due next Sunday night.\nLectures this week are on regression, starting with the windmill case study on Tuesday.\n\n2024-03-15 12:45:\n\nWorksheet 8 for tutorial on Monday. This will prepare you for Assignment 8, which opens on Monday night.\nAssignment 8 is the last assignment, but I will make worksheets the rest of the way, and there will be tutorials on the remaining Mondays. This is to help you get prepared for the final exam, which will definitely include some things that didn’t make it onto assignments (examples: the regression stuff we do next week, writing functions, Bayesian analysis, and anything else we get to).\n\n2024-03-13 11:20: my solutions to assignment 6.\n2024-03-12 11:00: Power went out here (on campus) for a few minutes, but is now back, whether from actual hydro or from a generator, I don’t know. So class goes ahead, as far as I know.\n2024-03-11 11:00: Monday update:\nThe midterm is marked. Stats: Q1 51.25 (76%), median 56 (83%), Q3 60 (89%). I will be sharing the marks and the marked midterms shortly. The marks will be on Quercus, and you will be receiving an email from Crowdmark with instructions to see your marked exam.\nAppeals are the same procedure as for assignments, between Mar 14 and Mar 21 inclusive. Do not expect me to overrule the grader’s judgment; thus, the only thing worth appealing is an actual grading error, such as an answer where the grader didn’t mark something relevant that you wrote, after consideration of my solutions and any comments on your exam. If you have not received full marks on a question part, you should have received a comment on your exam, or it should be obvious from my solutions what is missing or in error, or both of those things. Your appeal must include a clear description of the grading error (not grading judgment). If you appeal a grading judgment, you run the risk that I regrade your whole exam and your mark may go down as well as up. My philosophy on appeals is similar to that of Jeff Rosenthal.\nTutorials are happening today; worksheet 7. If you run out of time, as you probably will, you can leave the last question (the home prices data) until next week. - Assignment 6 was due last night. A reminder that there are no extensions, as stated in the course outline; you have the option of handing the assignment in before Tuesday night and taking the late penalty, or of counting it as one of your two worst assignments (or both). It is up to you to manage your time. - Assignment 7 opens tonight. - Lectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of tidying data (there are two other small sections of notes, “tidying extras” and “when pivot-wider goes wrong”).\nThursday: the first case study, on simple regression.\n\n2024-03-09 21:30: the end is in sight: the midterm is now 90% marked. I had a totally thrilling day getting the marking done that I assigned to myself on this exam, and I am now done. I’m not sure I shared my solutions, which are updated with extra comments on the bits that I marked.\n2024-03-08 21:15: two updates:\nthe midterm is now 62% marked. I spent today working on my other midterm, but tomorrow I plan to get to my marking on this one. The TAs are most of the way through their shares of the marking.\nthere is tutorial on Monday, in which you’ll be working on this worksheet, which will prepare you for Assignment 7 (that opens on Monday night).\n2024-03-07 22:15: a little bit of progress today: we are now at 33% done. I have been focusing on my other midterm, which I gave myself more of to mark.\n2024-03-06 23:00: the midterms are scanned and marking is underway. We are at 29% done.\n2024-03-05 13:30: the blog post about Tukey’s method that I mentioned in lecture, if you want more background.\n2024-03-04 11:00: Monday update:\nthere is no TA strike. Last night, the university and the TA union came to a “tentative agreement”, which the TAs still have to vote on (so we are not safe yet), but for now there is no strike.\non the midterm, questions 2(f) and 2(g) were impossible to answer with the information I gave you, so I have removed them from the exam (which is now out of 67 points).\nexam marking will begin once the exams have been scanned and uploaded to Crowdmark.\nreminder that there are no tutorials today. If you have not yet worked through worksheet 6, now would be a good time to do so, in preparation for Assignment 6 (which is due next Sunday night).\nlectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of analysis of variance\nThursday: tidying data - extra practice problems in PASIAS: chapter 13 (analysis of variance), chapter 17 (tidying data). The intervening chapters are on writing reports, on which there is lecture material, but I won’t be talking about that this time.\n\n2024-03-01 12:20:\n\nmy solutions to Assignment 5\nif you have to miss the midterm, the weight goes automatically onto the final exam. Complete an absence declaration so that there is a record. (added 2024-03-03 20:30: if you already used your absence declaration, I do not need to see any additional documentation, but any other professors affected by your absence might, so be prepared.)\nconversely, if your final exam is better than your midterm, the final exam counts instead of your midterm.\nthere will be no tutorials on Monday (regardless of whether the TAs are on strike) because if the TAs are working, they will be marking your midterm.\n\n2024-02-26 11:35: Monday update:\n\nMidterm time and location is on an announcement on Quercus labelled Midterm. See the notes from Feb 20 and 22 for course coverage and exam procedures.\nAssignment 5 was due last night. Assignment 6 opens tonight; you have two weeks to complete this (so that it is not due the same weekend as the midterm), but the material on it is on the midterm, so you would do well to work on it as part of your preparation.\nTutorial today, where you have the chance to ask subject-matter questions of your TAs as well as work on worksheet 6, which will prepare you for Assignment 6, which will help you prepare for the midterm.\nSee the Feb 20 note for what is on the midterm.\nLectures this week:\n\nTuesday: matched pairs sign test, Mood median test\nThursday: analysis of variance\n\nExtra practice problems in PASIAS (the chapters get out of order here):\n\nChapter 12: normal quantile plots\nChapter 11: matched pairs\nChapter 10: Mood’s median test\nChapter 13: analysis of variance.\n\nif you have questions as you prepare for the midterm, post them on the Quercus discussion board or catch me after lecture.\n\n2024-02-22 21:00: one more thing today: Worksheet 6, for tutorial on Monday. If you have subject-matter questions about the material on the exam, you can also ask your TA about those on Monday. If you have administrative questions about the exam that are not answered elsewhere, put them on the Quercus discussion board.\n2024-02-22 12:05:\n\nthe midterm is open-book. You can bring what you wish, such as your lecture notes, assignments, my slides, assignment solutions, etc, printed (no computers or other devices at the exam). You will need to organize whatever you bring, so that you can quickly find what you are looking for (and so there is an upper limit on what there is any point in bringing). If you are not well prepared, you can expect to run out of time; you will not have time to look everything up or go searching for things.\nthe exam is on its way to be printed. There are 6 questions, with a total of 30 parts worth 73 points altogether (the parts are typically worth 2 or 3 points and are about as much work as you would do on an assignment for 2 or 3 points). Expect to be writing code and explanations (for example, I might ask for code to do a task, or give you code or output and ask questions about it).\nat the exam, you will of course get an exam paper with spaces to write your answers, but you also get a booklet with numbered Figures to refer to during the exam. The exam will say things like “In Figure 10, what is…” and you will need to find Figure 10 in the other booklet.\nthis is a Crowdmark exam, so it is best to use a pen or a sharp pencil, otherwise we may have trouble reading your answers.\nlooking ahead to next week, there will be a tutorial on Monday for which there will be a worksheet (on the material from last week), and there will be lectures on Tuesday and Thursday on new material. This lecture material will not be on the midterm, but you can count on it being on the final exam, and it will help you understand what follows in the course.\n\n2024-02-20 13:40 (edit 14:05): ok, so there is a Tuesday update instead:\n\nAssignments 3 and 4 are graded, and I will post the marks in a moment. Appeals by the usual procedure, between Feb 23 and Mar 1 (for both). There was some work that was rather obviously AI-generated; I will decide whether I want to pursue academic integrity violations on any of it. A reminder that the sorts of things I ask you to do yourself on assignments are the same sorts of things you will need to do yourself on the exams, so by using anything other than your own brain and the course materials on the assignments, you are setting yourself up for failure on the exams.\nAssignment 3 appears to be graded; I will post the marks once I have confirmation from the grader. (edit: it has been graded.)\nCoverage for the midterm is what we did in lecture before reading week, up to and including the “cliffhanger” (that is to say, the matched pairs \\(t\\)-test).\n\n2024-02-18 22:15: A Sunday night “Monday update” to remind you that this upcoming week is Reading Week, so there are no tutorials tomorrow or lectures on Tuesday or Thursday. We resume on the 26th.\n2024-02-15 13:30: in what seems like a repeat of previous announcements, it is snowing, but I am here and campus is open, so class goes ahead. Today, normal quantile plots and however much of matched pairs we get to.\n2024-02-14 13:30: My solutions to Assignment 4.\n2024-02-12 10:50: Monday update:\n\ntutorials today; the worksheet.\nassignments:\n\nAssignment 2 is graded; I will release the marks shortly. Appeals by the same procedure as Assignment 1 between Feb 15 and Feb 22.\nAssignment 3 is almost graded.\nAssignment 4 was due last night. Reminders: the late penalty is 1% per hour; if you are a few minutes late, you will lose 1%, and it is not worth your time or mine to quibble about that. Also, a complete submission is the rendered version of your Quarto document; if your document does not render, it is up to you to find out why and to fix it.\nAssignment 5 opens tonight. You have two weeks to do this one (it is due on Sunday night at the end of reading week).\n\nlectures: I think I am done with power of hypothesis tests. There are some more examples in the lecture notes, which you can read if you want to gain some extra understanding.\n\nTuesday: sign test\nThursday: normal quantile plot, matched pairs\n\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 8 (power and sample size), 9 (sign test), 11 (matched pairs), 12 (normal quantile plots).\n\n2024-02-08 12:00: Worksheet 5 for Monday’s tutorial.\n2024-02-08 10:50: my solutions to Assignment 3.\n2024-02-06 11:30: On assignment 4, question 2, I was a little bit eager on the delete key! I just put back the actual question and the link to the data file, so that you now know what you were supposed to be doing. Re-download the questions from Quercus if you need to.\n2024-02-05 15:15: assignment planning: there will be no assignments due during reading week or the weekend of the midterm. That means you’ll get two weeks to do each of Assignment 5 (due the Sunday night at the end of reading week) and Assignment 6 (due March 10). The eighth and final assignment will be due on March 24, so you’ll get a break at the end of the course.\n2024-02-05 11:45: Monday update:\n\nTutorials happening today as usual; see the note three days ago for the worksheet.\nAssignments: there will be a delay in marking assignment #2 (which is my fault), but I now have graders for #2 and #3. #3 was due yesterday, but remains open until Tuesday with late penalty. #4 opens tonight.\nLectures:\n\nTuesday: the rest of the bootstrap stuff, including the code that we skipped last week.\nThursday: power of hypothesis tests. In with both of those is a procedure for how you might do simulations in general. My take is that statistical theory will only take you so far; you will run into places where the math is beyond you and simulation is the only way to understand what is happening.\n\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 8 for power. For examples of bootstrap distribution of sample mean, look in the Extras to the problems in chapters 6 and 7.\n\n2024-02-02 12:45: Worksheet 4, for tutorial on Monday.\n2024-02-01 10:30: My solutions to Assignment 2.\n2024-01-30 13:45: I was sure I had posted my solutions to assignment 1, but they seemed to have disappeared. Click the link just above to see them.\n2024-01-29 13:15: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 1 has been graded (see below for appeal procedure)\nAssignment 2 was due last night and is open (with late penalty) until Tuesday night\nAssignment 3 opens tonight, and is due next Sunday night.\nTutorials are happening today as usual; you’ll be working on worksheet 3.\nIn lectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of one-sample inference\nThursday: two-sample inference (which is a bit more complicated than you learned in B57). I might get into the bootstrap sampling distribution of the sample mean this week, or it might be next week.\n\nPractice problems for this week’s material: chapters 6 and 7 of PASIAS.\n\n2024-01-29 11:00: Assignment 1 has been graded, and I am about to post the marks.\n\nIf you wish to appeal your mark, first read sections 3.19 through 3.23 of the detailed course policies. For your appeal to be successful, you will need to demonstrate an error in the grading: that is to say, you will need to demonstrate that your work was actually correct despite not receiving full marks. Read carefully the last sentence of 3.19 as well as the whole of 3.20 in the detailed course policies. You are also warned that I have the right to regrade your entire assignment, and so your mark can go down as well as up.\nTo appeal your mark on an assignment, write me an email with the word “appeal”, the course code, and the assignment number in the subject line, for assignment 1 between February 2 and February 9 inclusive, in which you explain how there was an error in the grading of your assignment: that is to say, the grader missed something you wrote that was completely correct according to my solutions or that you argue also was a complete answer to the question. This also includes such things as addition errors in your assignment mark.\n\n2024-01-26 12:00: Worksheet 3 for tutorial on Monday. (Edit 2024-01-27 20:20: thanks to the eagle eyes of one of your TAs, a typo has been corrected.)\n2024-01-24 23:30: if you seem to be unable to create new Quarto documents, this is probably because you are running an old version of R Studio on your own computer. You can check what version you are currently running by selecting Help and About R Studio. Mine is 2023.12.0. Versions 2022.07.1 and newer include Quarto in them (including the ability to create new Quarto documents). If yours is older than that, now is a good time to upgrade.\n2024-01-24 11:25: We have a midterm date. See the announcement on Quercus for date, time, and place.\n2024-01-23 11:30: hint for one of the parts of Assignment 2: geom_line joins neighbouring points on a graph with a line.\n2024-01-22 13:40: this week:\n\nAssignment 1 was due last night, and remains open until Tuesday with late penalty.\ntutorial today, to work through Worksheet 2.\nAssignment 2, on the same material as worksheet 2, opens tonight and is due next Sunday night.\nin lectures this week:\n\nChoosing things from dataframes (this is a lot, but it goes fast)\nthe first part of statistical inference.\n\nMore practice problems: chapters 1 through about 6 of PASIAS.\n\n2024-01-18 22:00: I just took a look through the assignment 0’s that were handed in:\n\nIf you seemed to have done the right thing and I could see it including your graph, you should have 1 mark (out of 1). If you handed something in and for some reason it didn’t work, you’ll have a mark of zero plus a comment. Mostly this was that I couldn’t see your graph. If that happened to you, figure out how to fix it before you hand in assignment 1. (Hint: did you include the “embed-resources” thing described in 2(j) on Worksheet 1? If you had re-downloaded the file you handed in, you would have been able to see that your graph did not make it.)\nYou can have as many attempts at Assignment 0 as you wish. If you didn’t get it the first time, I encourage you to have another go. I intend to take a look in the next day or two at any more that are handed in since I looked just now.\nMy past experience is that most of the people who have trouble handing in Assignment 1 properly did not even attempt assignment 0. You have a free chance here to make sure that you understand the procedure.\n\n2024-01-18 15:30:\n\nWorksheet 2, on this week’s material, for tutorial on Monday.\nThe waitlist for this course is now closed. The course is full, so I will not enrol any extra people in the class (and bear in mind that everyone on the waitlist wanted to get into the course, so your reasons for getting in are not special). If you didn’t make it this year, you are welcome to try again next year, but be aware that you will need to register as early as possible. I try to save some places for 4th years (by UTSC’s definition: 14 or more credits).\n\n2024-01-15 11:00: On the agenda this week:\n\nAssignment 1, on the stuff you are doing on the worksheet today, will open tonight and be due next Sunday night (the 21st).\nLectures:\n\nmaking graphs (Tuesday)\nnumerical summaries, choosing things from dataframes (start) (Thursday)\n\nnext week’s tutorial (on Monday, a week from today) will feature a worksheet on the things in this week’s lectures.\nAssignment 2 (opening Monday next week) will also be on those things.\n\n2024-01-15 09:30: reminder: your tutorial is today, for practice on Worksheet 1 and handing in “Assignment 0” (the first “real assignment” will be due next week).\n2024-01-11 15:15:\n\nWorksheet 1, for practice on this week’s material.\nThe two datafiles I forgot earlier: coffee.txt, migraine.txt. You should be able to find course datafiles at a URL like http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/filename.txt where you replace filename.txt by whatever the file is called.\n\n2024-01-11 11:45: looking out of my office window, I might as well repeat Tuesday’s announcement!\n\nafter today’s lecture, I will post Worksheet 1, which gives you a chance to work through some of the stuff we’ve seen so far. You can work through it during tutorial, or before (and bring any problems or confusions to tutorial).\nAssignment 1 will open after Monday’s tutorial, and will be due the following Sunday night (Jan 21). Expect the same structure each week: working through the worksheet, with help available in tutorial, will prepare you for the next assignment, and doing the assignments (yourself!) will prepare you for the exams.\nData files for today’s lecture: test1.xls, test1.csv, test2.xls\n\n2024-01-09 10:40: campus is open, I am here, and the weather looks worse than it actually is, so class goes ahead today. On the agenda for this week:\n\ntoday: course outline and running R\nThursday: reading data from files.\n\n2024-01-08 12:25: first lecture is tomorrow; your ACORN has the location. Here is a short description of how things will go:\n\nTwo one-hour lectures a week, Tuesday and Thursday. I will have office hours after each lecture, or you can talk with me at the end of lecture, or you can post in the Quercus discussions for the course.\nYou should be registered in one of the three tutorials (on Mondays, starting next week, in week 2 of classes).\nIn tutorial, you will get a worksheet to work through yourself (with my answers and extra discussion). There will be at least one TA in attendance. Ask for help if you get stuck or confused.\nThere will be weekly assignments, with the first one opening on January 15 after tutorial (and due the following Sunday night). There will be about eight assignments altogether, with no assignments due during reading week or around the midterm.\nEach item helps you with the next on the list: doing the worksheet will help you with the corresponding assignment, and doing the assignments will help you with the exams.\nThe first part of the lecture notes contains the course outline. Read this now, to get a more detailed idea of what to expect.\n\n2024-01-03 11:10: lecture 1 is just under a week away. I am assuming that you are completely familiar with basic statistical techniques, such as:\n\nwhat graphs are available to you for each kind of data, and how to interpret them\nwhat a hypothesis test does and does not do\ntests for one and two and more than two means (\\(t\\)-tests for the first two and ANOVA for the third)\nhow to apply all of these to data and to interpret the results\nbasic probability distributions\nwe will learn how to do all of the above in R (I assume you know nothing about R).\n\nThere is very little actual math in this course, but there are a lot of ideas, and there is a lot of explanation of those ideas as they apply to data. Thus, you need to understand the theory that you have learned, but you also need to know how it applies to the data in front of you.\nIf you have learned some R before, you may see that I do things differently from what you learned before. I am expecting you to do things in this course as I teach them. All the work in this course can be done using ideas from this course, except where I say otherwise.\n2023-12-14 14:05: I found room for a few more students, 4th years in either our Major or Specialist programs. I know there are not very many C or D level courses in the winter semester, so these seemed to be the people whose need was greatest.\n2023-12-12 16:30: I’ve been doing some planning for this course. Here’s what to expect:\n\nlectures Tuesday and Thursday (1 hour each)\ntutorial Monday, in a computer lab, in which you will get a worksheet to work through on the material from the previous week’s lecture, with a TA or two around to help if you get stuck or confused. Tutorials start in week 2.\nweekly assignments open on Monday night, on the same material as the worksheet you just did, and are due the following Sunday night. The first assignment will open in week 2.\nthere will be about 8 assignments.\na midterm (2 hours) and a final exam (3 hours) as usual, on dates to be announced. I will move any assignments with due dates close to the midterm, as needed. My exams are always open book.\nthe worksheets will help you with the assignments, and the assignments will help you with the exams, provided you do them yourself.\n\n2023-08-10 13:30: I have asked to add some students to the course. These are all UTSC students, 4th years who joined the waitlist before August 9, and 3rd years who joined the waitlist before 10:30am on July 11. If you are still on the waitlist after this has been processed, you will have to take your chances.\n\n2024-03-15 12:45:\n\nWorksheet 8 for tutorial on Monday. This will prepare you for Assignment 8, which opens on Monday night.\nAssignment 8 is the last assignment, but I will make worksheets the rest of the way, and there will be tutorials on the remaining Mondays. This is to help you get prepared for the final exam, which will definitely include some things that didn’t make it onto assignments (examples: the regression stuff we do next week, writing functions, Bayesian analysis, and anything else we get to).\n\n2024-03-13 11:20: my solutions to assignment 6.\n2024-03-12 11:00: Power went out here (on campus) for a few minutes, but is now back, whether from actual hydro or from a generator, I don’t know. So class goes ahead, as far as I know.\n2024-03-11 11:00: Monday update:\n\nThe midterm is marked. Stats: Q1 51.25 (76%), median 56 (83%), Q3 60 (89%). I will be sharing the marks and the marked midterms shortly. The marks will be on Quercus, and you will be receiving an email from Crowdmark with instructions to see your marked exam.\n\nAppeals are the same procedure as for assignments, between Mar 14 and Mar 21 inclusive. Do not expect me to overrule the grader’s judgment; thus, the only thing worth appealing is an actual grading error, such as an answer where the grader didn’t mark something relevant that you wrote, after consideration of my solutions and any comments on your exam. If you have not received full marks on a question part, you should have received a comment on your exam, or it should be obvious from my solutions what is missing or in error, or both of those things. Your appeal must include a clear description of the grading error (not grading judgment). If you appeal a grading judgment, you run the risk that I regrade your whole exam and your mark may go down as well as up. My philosophy on appeals is similar to that of Jeff Rosenthal.\n\nTutorials are happening today; worksheet 7. If you run out of time, as you probably will, you can leave the last question (the home prices data) until next week.\nAssignment 6 was due last night. A reminder that there are no extensions, as stated in the course outline; you have the option of handing the assignment in before Tuesday night and taking the late penalty, or of counting it as one of your two worst assignments (or both). It is up to you to manage your time.\nAssignment 7 opens tonight.\nLectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of tidying data (there are two other small sections of notes, “tidying extras” and “when pivot-wider goes wrong”).\nThursday: the first case study, on simple regression.\n\n\n2024-03-09 21:30: the end is in sight: the midterm is now 90% marked. I had a totally thrilling day getting the marking done that I assigned to myself on this exam, and I am now done. I’m not sure I shared my solutions, which are updated with extra comments on the bits that I marked.\n2024-03-08 21:15: two updates:\n\nthe midterm is now 62% marked. I spent today working on my other midterm, but tomorrow I plan to get to my marking on this one. The TAs are most of the way through their shares of the marking.\nthere is tutorial on Monday, in which you’ll be working on this worksheet, which will prepare you for Assignment 7 (that opens on Monday night).\n\n2024-03-07 22:15: a little bit of progress today: we are now at 33% done. I have been focusing on my other midterm, which I gave myself more of to mark.\n2024-03-06 23:00: the midterms are scanned and marking is underway. We are at 29% done.\n2024-03-05 13:30: the blog post about Tukey’s method that I mentioned in lecture, if you want more background.\n2024-03-04 11:00: Monday update:\n\nthere is no TA strike. Last night, the university and the TA union came to a “tentative agreement”, which the TAs still have to vote on (so we are not safe yet), but for now there is no strike.\non the midterm, questions 2(f) and 2(g) were impossible to answer with the information I gave you, so I have removed them from the exam (which is now out of 67 points).\nexam marking will begin once the exams have been scanned and uploaded to Crowdmark.\nreminder that there are no tutorials today. If you have not yet worked through worksheet 6, now would be a good time to do so, in preparation for Assignment 6 (which is due next Sunday night).\nlectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of analysis of variance\nThursday: tidying data\n\nextra practice problems in PASIAS: chapter 13 (analysis of variance), chapter 17 (tidying data). The intervening chapters are on writing reports, on which there is lecture material, but I won’t be talking about that this time.\n\n2024-03-01 12:20:\n\nmy solutions to Assignment 5\nif you have to miss the midterm, the weight goes automatically onto the final exam. Complete an absence declaration so that there is a record. (added 2024-03-03 20:30: if you already used your absence declaration, I do not need to see any additional documentation, but any other professors affected by your absence might, so be prepared.)\nconversely, if your final exam is better than your midterm, the final exam counts instead of your midterm.\nthere will be no tutorials on Monday (regardless of whether the TAs are on strike) because if the TAs are working, they will be marking your midterm.\n\n2024-02-26 11:35: Monday update:\n\nMidterm time and location is on an announcement on Quercus labelled Midterm. See the notes from Feb 20 and 22 for course coverage and exam procedures.\nAssignment 5 was due last night. Assignment 6 opens tonight; you have two weeks to complete this (so that it is not due the same weekend as the midterm), but the material on it is on the midterm, so you would do well to work on it as part of your preparation.\nTutorial today, where you have the chance to ask subject-matter questions of your TAs as well as work on worksheet 6, which will prepare you for Assignment 6, which will help you prepare for the midterm.\nSee the Feb 20 note for what is on the midterm.\nLectures this week:\n\nTuesday: matched pairs sign test, Mood median test\nThursday: analysis of variance\n\nExtra practice problems in PASIAS (the chapters get out of order here):\n\nChapter 12: normal quantile plots\nChapter 11: matched pairs\nChapter 10: Mood’s median test\nChapter 13: analysis of variance.\n\nif you have questions as you prepare for the midterm, post them on the Quercus discussion board or catch me after lecture.\n\n2024-02-22 21:00: one more thing today: Worksheet 6, for tutorial on Monday. If you have subject-matter questions about the material on the exam, you can also ask your TA about those on Monday. If you have administrative questions about the exam that are not answered elsewhere, put them on the Quercus discussion board.\n2024-02-22 12:05:\n\nthe midterm is open-book. You can bring what you wish, such as your lecture notes, assignments, my slides, assignment solutions, etc, printed (no computers or other devices at the exam). You will need to organize whatever you bring, so that you can quickly find what you are looking for (and so there is an upper limit on what there is any point in bringing). If you are not well prepared, you can expect to run out of time; you will not have time to look everything up or go searching for things.\nthe exam is on its way to be printed. There are 6 questions, with a total of 30 parts worth 73 points altogether (the parts are typically worth 2 or 3 points and are about as much work as you would do on an assignment for 2 or 3 points). Expect to be writing code and explanations (for example, I might ask for code to do a task, or give you code or output and ask questions about it).\nat the exam, you will of course get an exam paper with spaces to write your answers, but you also get a booklet with numbered Figures to refer to during the exam. The exam will say things like “In Figure 10, what is…” and you will need to find Figure 10 in the other booklet.\nthis is a Crowdmark exam, so it is best to use a pen or a sharp pencil, otherwise we may have trouble reading your answers.\nlooking ahead to next week, there will be a tutorial on Monday for which there will be a worksheet (on the material from last week), and there will be lectures on Tuesday and Thursday on new material. This lecture material will not be on the midterm, but you can count on it being on the final exam, and it will help you understand what follows in the course.\n\n2024-02-20 13:40 (edit 14:05): ok, so there is a Tuesday update instead:\n\nAssignments 3 and 4 are graded, and I will post the marks in a moment. Appeals by the usual procedure, between Feb 23 and Mar 1 (for both). There was some work that was rather obviously AI-generated; I will decide whether I want to pursue academic integrity violations on any of it. A reminder that the sorts of things I ask you to do yourself on assignments are the same sorts of things you will need to do yourself on the exams, so by using anything other than your own brain and the course materials on the assignments, you are setting yourself up for failure on the exams.\nAssignment 3 appears to be graded; I will post the marks once I have confirmation from the grader. (edit: it has been graded.)\nCoverage for the midterm is what we did in lecture before reading week, up to and including the “cliffhanger” (that is to say, the matched pairs \\(t\\)-test).\n\n2024-02-18 22:15: A Sunday night “Monday update” to remind you that this upcoming week is Reading Week, so there are no tutorials tomorrow or lectures on Tuesday or Thursday. We resume on the 26th.\n2024-02-15 13:30: in what seems like a repeat of previous announcements, it is snowing, but I am here and campus is open, so class goes ahead. Today, normal quantile plots and however much of matched pairs we get to.\n2024-02-14 13:30: My solutions to Assignment 4.\n2024-02-12 10:50: Monday update:\n\ntutorials today; the worksheet.\nassignments:\n\nAssignment 2 is graded; I will release the marks shortly. Appeals by the same procedure as Assignment 1 between Feb 15 and Feb 22.\nAssignment 3 is almost graded.\nAssignment 4 was due last night. Reminders: the late penalty is 1% per hour; if you are a few minutes late, you will lose 1%, and it is not worth your time or mine to quibble about that. Also, a complete submission is the rendered version of your Quarto document; if your document does not render, it is up to you to find out why and to fix it.\nAssignment 5 opens tonight. You have two weeks to do this one (it is due on Sunday night at the end of reading week).\n\nlectures: I think I am done with power of hypothesis tests. There are some more examples in the lecture notes, which you can read if you want to gain some extra understanding.\n\nTuesday: sign test\nThursday: normal quantile plot, matched pairs\n\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 8 (power and sample size), 9 (sign test), 11 (matched pairs), 12 (normal quantile plots).\n\n2024-02-08 12:00: Worksheet 5 for Monday’s tutorial.\n2024-02-08 10:50: my solutions to Assignment 3.\n2024-02-06 11:30: On assignment 4, question 2, I was a little bit eager on the delete key! I just put back the actual question and the link to the data file, so that you now know what you were supposed to be doing. Re-download the questions from Quercus if you need to.\n2024-02-05 15:15: assignment planning: there will be no assignments due during reading week or the weekend of the midterm. That means you’ll get two weeks to do each of Assignment 5 (due the Sunday night at the end of reading week) and Assignment 6 (due March 10). The eighth and final assignment will be due on March 24, so you’ll get a break at the end of the course.\n2024-02-05 11:45: Monday update:\n\nTutorials happening today as usual; see the note three days ago for the worksheet.\nAssignments: there will be a delay in marking assignment #2 (which is my fault), but I now have graders for #2 and #3. #3 was due yesterday, but remains open until Tuesday with late penalty. #4 opens tonight.\nLectures:\n\nTuesday: the rest of the bootstrap stuff, including the code that we skipped last week.\nThursday: power of hypothesis tests. In with both of those is a procedure for how you might do simulations in general. My take is that statistical theory will only take you so far; you will run into places where the math is beyond you and simulation is the only way to understand what is happening.\n\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 8 for power. For examples of bootstrap distribution of sample mean, look in the Extras to the problems in chapters 6 and 7.\n\n2024-02-02 12:45: Worksheet 4, for tutorial on Monday.\n2024-02-01 10:30: My solutions to Assignment 2.\n2024-01-30 13:45: I was sure I had posted my solutions to assignment 1, but they seemed to have disappeared. Click the link just above to see them.\n2024-01-29 13:15: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 1 has been graded (see below for appeal procedure)\nAssignment 2 was due last night and is open (with late penalty) until Tuesday night\nAssignment 3 opens tonight, and is due next Sunday night.\nTutorials are happening today as usual; you’ll be working on worksheet 3.\nIn lectures this week:\n\nTuesday: the rest of one-sample inference\nThursday: two-sample inference (which is a bit more complicated than you learned in B57). I might get into the bootstrap sampling distribution of the sample mean this week, or it might be next week.\n\nPractice problems for this week’s material: chapters 6 and 7 of PASIAS.\n\n2024-01-29 11:00: Assignment 1 has been graded, and I am about to post the marks.\n\nIf you wish to appeal your mark, first read sections 3.19 through 3.23 of the detailed course policies. For your appeal to be successful, you will need to demonstrate an error in the grading: that is to say, you will need to demonstrate that your work was actually correct despite not receiving full marks. Read carefully the last sentence of 3.19 as well as the whole of 3.20 in the detailed course policies. You are also warned that I have the right to regrade your entire assignment, and so your mark can go down as well as up.\nTo appeal your mark on an assignment, write me an email with the word “appeal”, the course code, and the assignment number in the subject line, for assignment 1 between February 2 and February 9 inclusive, in which you explain how there was an error in the grading of your assignment: that is to say, the grader missed something you wrote that was completely correct according to my solutions or that you argue also was a complete answer to the question. This also includes such things as addition errors in your assignment mark.\n\n2024-01-26 12:00: Worksheet 3 for tutorial on Monday. (Edit 2024-01-27 20:20: thanks to the eagle eyes of one of your TAs, a typo has been corrected.)\n2024-01-24 23:30: if you seem to be unable to create new Quarto documents, this is probably because you are running an old version of R Studio on your own computer. You can check what version you are currently running by selecting Help and About R Studio. Mine is 2023.12.0. Versions 2022.07.1 and newer include Quarto in them (including the ability to create new Quarto documents). If yours is older than that, now is a good time to upgrade.\n2024-01-24 11:25: We have a midterm date. See the announcement on Quercus for date, time, and place.\n2024-01-23 11:30: hint for one of the parts of Assignment 2: geom_line joins neighbouring points on a graph with a line.\n2024-01-22 13:40: this week:\n\nAssignment 1 was due last night, and remains open until Tuesday with late penalty.\ntutorial today, to work through Worksheet 2.\nAssignment 2, on the same material as worksheet 2, opens tonight and is due next Sunday night.\nin lectures this week:\n\nChoosing things from dataframes (this is a lot, but it goes fast)\nthe first part of statistical inference.\n\nMore practice problems: chapters 1 through about 6 of PASIAS.\n\n2024-01-18 22:00: I just took a look through the assignment 0’s that were handed in:\n\nIf you seemed to have done the right thing and I could see it including your graph, you should have 1 mark (out of 1). If you handed something in and for some reason it didn’t work, you’ll have a mark of zero plus a comment. Mostly this was that I couldn’t see your graph. If that happened to you, figure out how to fix it before you hand in assignment 1. (Hint: did you include the “embed-resources” thing described in 2(j) on Worksheet 1? If you had re-downloaded the file you handed in, you would have been able to see that your graph did not make it.)\nYou can have as many attempts at Assignment 0 as you wish. If you didn’t get it the first time, I encourage you to have another go. I intend to take a look in the next day or two at any more that are handed in since I looked just now.\nMy past experience is that most of the people who have trouble handing in Assignment 1 properly did not even attempt assignment 0. You have a free chance here to make sure that you understand the procedure.\n\n2024-01-18 15:30:\n\nWorksheet 2, on this week’s material, for tutorial on Monday.\nThe waitlist for this course is now closed. The course is full, so I will not enrol any extra people in the class (and bear in mind that everyone on the waitlist wanted to get into the course, so your reasons for getting in are not special). If you didn’t make it this year, you are welcome to try again next year, but be aware that you will need to register as early as possible. I try to save some places for 4th years (by UTSC’s definition: 14 or more credits).\n\n2024-01-15 11:00: On the agenda this week:\n\nAssignment 1, on the stuff you are doing on the worksheet today, will open tonight and be due next Sunday night (the 21st).\nLectures:\n\nmaking graphs (Tuesday)\nnumerical summaries, choosing things from dataframes (start) (Thursday)\n\nnext week’s tutorial (on Monday, a week from today) will feature a worksheet on the things in this week’s lectures.\nAssignment 2 (opening Monday next week) will also be on those things.\n\n2024-01-15 09:30: reminder: your tutorial is today, for practice on Worksheet 1 and handing in “Assignment 0” (the first “real assignment” will be due next week).\n2024-01-11 15:15:\n\nWorksheet 1, for practice on this week’s material.\nThe two datafiles I forgot earlier: coffee.txt, migraine.txt. You should be able to find course datafiles at a URL like http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/filename.txt where you replace filename.txt by whatever the file is called.\n\n2024-01-11 11:45: looking out of my office window, I might as well repeat Tuesday’s announcement!\n\nafter today’s lecture, I will post Worksheet 1, which gives you a chance to work through some of the stuff we’ve seen so far.

All the work in this course can be done using ideas from this course, except where I say otherwise.\n2023-12-14 14:05: I found room for a few more students, 4th years in either our Major or Specialist programs.

I have room to add a few more students. I will be prioritizing 4th years, since I know that majors/minors/specialists require a certain number of upper-level courses to complete their programs. If there is room to admit 3rd years, I will do so in the order that they joined the waitlist. This is (historically) a popular class, and it is up to you to register for it as early as possible if you want to get in. Do not appeal to me for special treatment. The choice of students to add is mine.",

This is the place to look for things course-related (notes, code, old exams etc., linked above) except for lecture videos, assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on Quercus (link to 2025 page).\n\n\n\n\n2025-04-19 20:30: we have course grades! I am about to submit them to my department, and then they go through the process I described yesterday.\n\nIf you did not write the final exam, I submit a grade for you with a zero for the work not done, and that is replaced by an “SDF” once your deferred final is approved. Once you write the deferred exam, your course grade is recalculated.\nIf you believe your grade is incorrect, or wish it was different from what it is, the only options you have are the ones described on this page (including the two links at the bottom). Contacting me, or anyone else, about your grade is, you will note, not one of your options.\nWishing everyone an enjoyable summer and, for those graduating this year, I wish you success in whatever your life brings next.\n\n2025-04-18 22:30: it appears that we are now 100% done marking the final exam! Next (as in, not tonight) I look over the marking, and then calculate course grades. The process is, after I calculate and submit the course grades, they are approved by my department, then they go to the Registrar’s office, then, in a day or two after that, they come to you.\n2025-04-17 21:30: progress: up to 70% done, with all of us being busy today.\n2025-04-16 22:45: we are now at 37% done (as I write); both of our TAs have started work on their questions. I have been updating my solutions (link yesterday) with extra things I’m noticing while marking.\n2025-04-15 22:30: a day of marking (for me), so we are now 21% done: that is to say, 8 of the 39 questions are marked. My solutions.\n2025-04-14 23:10: we have scanned exams and grading is under way: that is to say, I have marked two questions, so we are now 5% done.\n2025-04-09 14:30: worksheet 12 solutions are up on the worksheets page. Sorry for the delay: I forgot to post them.\n2025-04-07 13:00:\n\npre-exam office hours on Wednesday April 9, 1:00-3:00pm. I realize that this is the first day of finals, so if you have an afternoon exam that day, there is time to pop in before that.\nyou have until tomorrow (I think it is) to complete a course evaluation, if you have not done so. These are used by my department to assess effectiveness of teaching, so if you have something to say on that, make sure you say it.\n\n2025-04-03 15:45:\n\nthe final exam is about to go for printing. It has 39 questions based on 7 scenarios worth a total of 87 points.\nmy solutions to worksheet 12 are up on the worksheets page.\n\n2025-04-01 16:30 edited 2025-04-02 16:30: Assignments 7 and 8 are marked, and the marks are posted. Any appeals by usual process between Apr 4 and Apr 9 for both (so that I can get them out of the way before the final exam).\n2025-03-28 15:30: Friday update time:\n\none more week to go. Lecture is on multiway frequency tables, as analyzed by log-linear models. I like to end with this because it has a lot in common with regression, so many of the ideas are familiar (though there are one or two that are not).\nsolutions to last week’s worksheet, and a worksheet for the upcoming week are on the worksheets page.\nMore practice problems in PASIAS chapter 42.\nFinal exam is on April 12. I will post an announcement on Quercus with where and exactly when. I will have extra office hours sometime during the week before (thinking probably Wednesday).\n\n2025-03-24 12:20: a couple of notes:\n\nAssignment 8 is closed. My solutions to it are on the assignment solutions page.\nIf your final exam mark is higher than your midterm mark, the final counts instead of the midterm.\n\n2025-03-21 16:00: Friday update:\n\nAssignment 8 and last is due tonight. My solutions to Assignment 7 are up on the assignment solutions page.\nMy solutions to Worksheet 10 are up on the worksheets page.\nNext week’s lectures are on drawing maps and principal components. I don’t think we’ll have time to get to factor analysis this time around, but the ideas there should make sense once we have studied principal components. There is a worksheet 11 up on those.\nPASIAS chapter 38 on maps and chapter 40 on principal components.\n\n2025-03-19 13:20:\n\nthanks to the student who found a discrepancy in the discriminant analysis lecture notes. I went through those notes and the cluster analysis ones (where I feared there would be similar problems), and the versions of those two sets of slides on the lecture notes page should now be correct.\nI think I am now up to date on all the appeals and Quercus discussion board posts.\n\n2025-03-17 10:45: we have midterm marks!\n\nmy solutions\nstats: Q3 52 (78%), median 45.5 (68%), Q1 37 (55%). These are about in line with historical averages for my exams.\nyou will see your mark on Quercus shortly\nyou will get an email from Crowdmark with instructions for accessing your marked exam in it. If you have not earned full marks for a question, you should have a comment from the grader on your marked exam; that, plus a review of my solutions, should help you understand why you did not earn full marks.\nI am happy that the graders have marked consistently and in accordance with my solutions, and therefore I am not allowing appeals of the midterm marks. The marking is, if anything, generous. You should be able to answer any questions about the marking by carefully reading the grader’s comments and carefully reading my solutions.\n\n2025-03-16 20:30: the exam is now at 97% marked, just part of question 14 left.\n2025-03-15 10:45: your TAs had a busy Friday, and we are now all the way to 90% done marking the midterm.\n2025-03-14.159265359: happy pi day!\n\nMidterm marking is now 60% done.\nLectures next week are on cluster analysis. I think we are on course to finish everything: maps (maybe) and principal components the week after next, multiway frequency tables in the last week. (Yes, we are that near the end.)\nPASIAS for cluster analysis: chapters 36 and 37.\nAssignments: assignment 7 is due tonight; assignment 8 opens today and is due on Mar 21.\nAssignment 8 is based on worksheets 8 and 9. There is also a worksheet 10, which is on the worksheets page, along with solutions to worksheet 9.\nNow I need to get back to marking exams!\n\n2025-03-13 21:15: we are past halfway, 55% done as I write.\n2025-03-12 22:00: there is a limit to how much exam marking I can do on a lecture day, and I have reached it. Exam is 40% marked.\n2025-03-11 22:30: midterm is 25% marked, and I am out of juice.\n2025-03-11 11:45:\n\nassignment 6 is marked, grades being posted shortly. Appeals by usual procedure between Mar 14 and 21 inclusive.\nI have looked at all the appeals for assignment 3. The other appeals will have to wait until I have finished marking my share of the midterms.\nas of right now, we are 10% done marking the midterms (I have marked two more questions this morning).\n\n2025-03-10 23:00: The exams are scanned and on Crowdmark. We are now at the dizzying heights of 3% done (meaning, I have marked one question). I was going to do a second one tonight, but I ran out of juice. Tomorrow, I am hoping to make some decent progress.\n2025-03-08 13:30: the update turned out to be so late that it is now Saturday!\n\nThe midterm will be scanned on (probably) Monday, and marking will begin after that. I may not have much time this coming week outside of lectures because I will be marking my share of your midterm.\nNow that you have written the exam, you can get back to the repeated measures material. There is a worksheet 8 on the worksheets page about that; the answers are also up. (There is also a worksheet 9 on the upcoming week’s material.)\nNext week’s lecture is on discriminant analysis. This is the natural followup to MANOVA; you’ll remember that MANOVA doesn’t tell us much beyond “there is something going on”, and discriminant analysis will help you discover what the “something” is.\nAssignment 7 is due on March 14. Assignment 8 opens on that day, and is due on March 21. Assignment 8 is on the material in worksheets 8 and 9. There are no more assignments after that. (I appreciate that you may have term papers and the like that are due at the end of classes, and I don’t want to be part of that problem.) There will be worksheets the rest of the way to help you practice what you have learned.\nIf you want extra practice, PASIAS is the place to look:\n\nChapter 33 is MANOVA\nChapter 34 is repeated measures\nChapter 35 is discriminant analysis.\n\n\n2025-03-07 17:30: A very late Friday update (which I will add to later):\n\nMidterm exam tonight! See the Quercus announcement for place and time (we are in two rooms, so make sure you are in the correct one). If you miss the midterm for any reason, the weight goes onto the final exam. I do not need documentation for this.\n\n2025-03-05 17:00: Assignment 6 solutions are up on the assignment solution page.\n2025-03-05 13:10: I have just updated the MANOVA and repeated measures lecture notes:\n\nthere was a question on Monday about Box’s M test for interactions (in the peanuts example). I have added a little about this to the lecture notes, and put a more detailed answer on the Quercus discussion board.\nI fitted the mixed model (for the dogs) wrong in repeated measures. I used time (quantitative) in my model, which assumes a linear relationship with time. This is not what I wanted; I wanted to see whether there was any relationship with time (or any interaction between time and drug), so the right way is to treat time as categorical, which is done using the “temporary” column I called timex. The results from the mixed model are now more or less consistent with the MANOVA approach, which is how it should be.\nThe revised slides (for both) are now on the lecture notes page.\nI will (hopefully) give the Monday folks a brief summary next week of what changed. However, you may need to remind me, because this is exactly the kind of thing I tend to forget!\n\n2025-02-28 11:10 with additions 2025-03-03 11:15: Friday update (back to the usual day this week):\n\nreminder of midterm on Mar 7:\n\nSee Quercus announcement for time, place, and details. One thing I forgot to mention: the rules for the exams in this course are the same as for STAC32: bring any printed material you like, but make sure it’s organized, or else you will waste too much time looking things up.\nmaterial on the midterm is everything up to and including last week’s lecture. Last week’s (Thursday) update will tell you what that is.\nthe midterm has gone for printing. It has 6 scenarios with 30 questions total, worth a total of 67 marks.\n(added 2025-03-03 11:15) other exam rules for this course are the same as for STAC32. In particular, if you miss the midterm (for any reason), the weight is transferred to the final exam.\n\nAssignments:\n\nAssignment 4 is graded, and the marks will be posted shortly. (Added 2025-03-03 11:15: I forgot to post the marks, but they are posted now.) Appeals by usual procedure between Mar 5 and Mar 12.\nAssignment 6 is due tonight and is open until Sunday night (with late penalty).\nAssignment 7 (on the same material as Worksheet 7) will open today, but is not due until Mar 14. You may want to start work on it to help you prepare for the midterm.\nI deal with appeals at the end of the date range for each assignment, so that I can look at them all together.\n\nLecture next week:\n\nthe remainder of MANOVA (quickly, since there are only a few new ideas in the second example)\nrepeated measures\n\nWorksheets:\n\nMy solutions to worksheet 7 are up on the worksheets page.\nWorksheet 8 is also up on the worksheets page.\n\n\n2025-02-26 10:30: if you are appealing an assignment mark, you need to note the dates between which appeals are accepted: starting tomorrow for Assignment 3, starting Friday for Assignment 5. Any appeals already submitted for these assignments are too early, and will need to be re-submitted at the right time.\n2025-02-25 14:20: assignment 5 is graded. Appeals between Feb 28 and Mar 7 by the usual process, which is:\n\nsend me an email with the word “appeal” and the course and assignment number in the subject header between the appropriate dates\nexplain precisely which question on the assignment has been incorrectly graded according to my solutions/the rubric, and how your answer is correct.\n“my answer is the same as the solutions” is not persuasive, because the grader clearly thought it was not.\nthe appeal process is for correcting errors. I will not overturn a grader’s judgement (eg. about part marks).\n\n2025-02-24 10:35: Assignments:\n\nAssignment 3 is graded. Any appeals between Feb 27 and Mar 6 inclusive by the usual process.\nAssignment 4 and 5 grading is under way.\nAssignment 6 is open, and is due on Friday (Feb 28).\n\n2025-02-20 14:20: we appear to have a Thursday update this week:\n\nAssignment 6 is due on Feb 28 (Friday of the first week back after reading week)\nMy solutions to Assignments 4 and 5 are up on the assignment solutions page.\nGrading of Assignments 3 and 4 is under way.\nNext week’s lecture is on some or all of these, in this order:\n\ncontrasts (at the end of the ANOVA Revisited slides)\nanalysis of covariance\nmultivariate analysis of variance with link to discussion of Box M test\n\nWhatever of these we get to is on the midterm; anything we don’t (which might be some of MANOVA) is not. There is a lecture the week of Mar 3, scheduled to be on repeated measures. This will not be on the midterm, but will be on the final exam (you can count on it), so miss it at your peril!\nIt is up to you to organize your own review for the midterm. I have twelve weeks of material to share with you, so we need to keep going.\nThe current draft of the midterm has 6 scenarios with a total of 30 questions, but that may change between now and the midterm date.\nThere is a Worksheet 7 up on the Worksheets page, which is on the material in next week’s lecture.\nLooking ahead, Assignment 7 is not due until Mar 14 (so that you don’t have an assignment due the same day as the midterm), but starting it early will help you prepare for the midterm. It will open on Feb 28.\n\n2025-02-14 11:45: Friday update:\n\nnext week is reading week! No lectures on Mon/Wed and no assignment due on Friday of reading week.\nAssignment 5 is due tonight (open until Sun with late penalty).\nWorksheet 6 solutions are up on the worksheets page.\nAssignment 6, on this week’s material, is open but is not due until Feb 28.\nWhen we come back from reading week, the Feb 24/26 lecture will be on some or all of:\n\ncontrasts (at the end of the ANOVA Revisited slides)\nanalysis of covariance\nmultivariate analysis of variance\n\nHave a happy Family Day!\n\n2025-02-11 16:30: weather forecast is calling for a snowstorm right after lecture ends tomorrow. Check the university status page to make sure that campus is open before you head in. If campus is closed there is, of course, no lecture, but if campus is open and the snowstorm is imminent, my contingency plan is to do lecture without a break and end early so that you can get home.\n\nEdit 2025-02-12 12:30: contingency plan applies: we’ll go without a break and finish before 3:30 today. No office hours today, since I want to get home too! Catch me after class or post on the quercus discussion board if you have questions.\n\n2025-02-07 15:30: a late Friday update this week, because I have been marking deferred exams:\n\nLecture next week is ANOVA revisited, including two-way ANOVA, interactions, simple effects, contrasts and the like.\nOn the worksheets page, solutions to worksheet 5 and questions for worksheet 6 (on the ANOVA stuff).\nFor extra practice on this material, see PASIAS chapter 31.\nAssignment 4 is due tonight, and Assignment 5 is open.\nLooking ahead a bit, Feb 17-21 is reading week; there are no lectures that week, and no assignment is due. (Assignment 5 is due just before reading week, and assignment 6 will not be due until the end of the week after reading week, ie. Feb 28). There will also be no assignment due the day of the midterm, and after that the worksheets and assignments will probably be out of sync number-wise.\n\n2025-02-06 20:45: worksheet 5 solutions are up on the worksheets page. Assignment 5 opens at midnight.\n2025-02-03 15:15: On Assignment 4 question 5, if you cannot get step to work for you without giving an error message: show the error message in the work you hand in (you will probably also need to add #| error: true as the top line of the code chunk in question), and then proceed in question 6 as if the best model has bill length, bill depth, and sex in it (if step does not work for you, you will need to explicitly fit this model in order to obtain predictions later).\n2025-02-03 12:15: Assignment update:\n\nAssignment 4 is open.\nAssignment 3 is closed and solutions are posted on the assignment solutions page.\nAssignment 2 is marked. Appeals by usual process between Feb 6 and Feb 13 inclusive.\n\n2025-01-31 14:30: Friday update:\n\nMidterm date, time, and place is official. See the announcement on Quercus for details. (I am not sharing details with anyone outside the class, for your safety.) Material is probably up to the week before the midterm, but it is too soon to say specifically what that will be.\nLecture next week on survival analysis.\nWorksheet 4 solutions and worksheet 5 questions are up on the worksheets page.\nFor extra practice on survival analysis, see Chapter 30 of PASIAS.\nAssignment 3 is due tonight (open until Sunday night), and assignment 4 is open now.\n\n2025-01-27 11:00: Assignment 2 is closed. My solutions are on the assignment solutions page. The cold is improving, though I still have a cough. Assignment 3 is open.\n2025-01-24 14:30: Friday update:\n\nwe have a tentative midterm date of March 7. I will let you know when this is official, though it is not likely to change.\nnext week’s lectures on:\n\nthe rest of logistic regression, that is to say the odds and ends at the end of the brand-preference example.\ndates and times, possibly also including durations, intervals, and periods.\nThe reason for looking at dates and times now is to prepare us for survival analysis, which is the study of the time until an event happens.\n\nworksheets, on the worksheets page:\n\nsolutions to #3 are up (thanks to the student who reminded me)\nworksheet #4 is up, which will make sense after next week’s lecture (though in fact you may be able to do some of it now).\n\nassignments:\n\n#2 due tonight, open until Sunday night\n#3 opened today, and is due on Friday of next week. Reminder that each assignment is based on the worksheet with the same number.\n\n\n2025-01-23 15:30: Assignment 1 is graded, and I am about to release the marks. Appeals by the same procedure as STAC32 between Jan 26 and Feb 2 inclusive: that is to say, for your appeal to be successful, you will have to demonstrate that your work was graded inconsistently with my solutions and the rubric (see next sentence). This time, the grader created a rubric that you can see, which will also help to explain why you earned the mark you did (as well as making the grading quicker and more consistent).\n2025-01-22 11:55: my cold continues. I did about 90 minutes of class on Monday before running out of energy, and I expect today to be about the same. On Monday, I went more or less straight home after class and took a nap, and I may need to do the same today. So, don’t count on finding me in my office after class today; if you have questions, ask me after lecture, or put them on the Quercus discussion board.\n2025-01-20 11:35:\n\nI have a cold. Try not to get too close to me this week. I feel as if I am running at half speed. Anyway, we will get to where we get. If I am out of juice, we may end early this week. Curiously, the material on worksheet 3 and assignment 3 is only about the first half of what I was planning to do this week, so it is actually OK if we don’t get as far as I had originally planned.\nSolutions to Assignment 1 (which is now closed) are on the assignment solutions page.\n\n2025-01-17 14:20: we appear to be on a Friday update this week. To add to the earlier reminders:\n\nworksheet 2 solutions on the worksheets page; assignment 2 opens today.\nnext week’s lecture on the second half of logistic regression, starting with the coal-miners example. There is some stuff about odds ratios and relative risk that I may or may not talk about; also, my recollection is that the second half of logistic regression takes a while to work through because there is a fair bit of detail. There is a worksheet 3 already up on this stuff; for further examples and practice, see PASIAS chapter 28 (also, maybe chapter 29, depending on how far we get).\n\n2025-01-13 11:15: some reminders:\n\nworksheet 1 solutions are on the worksheets page.\nassignment 1 is open, due on Friday (Jan 17) on the same material as Worksheet 1. My solutions to it will go up after it closes.\nthis week’s lecture on logistic regression, up until about the stuff on odds and log-odds.\nworksheet 2 is on the worksheets page, and should make sense after this week’s lecture. My solutions to it will go up on the same page towards the end of the week.\nmore practice problems in PASIAS chapter 27.\nassignment 2 will open on Friday Jan 17 and will be due on Friday Jan 24.\n\n2025-01-09 12:20: it feels rather strange to say that week 1 is done, but for me it is. A couple of reminders:\n\nworksheet 1, on the worksheets page, is available for practice on the stuff we did in class this week. I will post my solutions in the same place tonight (if I remember) or tomorrow (if I don’t). (If the worksheets display in an odd order, use the pulldown above the list of files to display them in file name order.)\nassigment 1, on Quercus, opens tomorrow and is due on Jan 17 (at 11:59pm).\nnext week’s lecture: approximately the first half of logistic regression.\n\n2025-01-05 20:00: Sunday update (not sure yet whether this will be a regular thing):\n\nclasses start Monday (section 2), Wednesday (section 1), place and time in Acorn\nthis week, course outline that is very similar to C32’s, some multiple regression stuff that is partly review and partly some new ideas. Some of the more review-y stuff I will speed through or skip depending how we’re doing for time.\nthere is a worksheets page that has the questions for a Worksheet 1 that will make sense after this week’s class.\nsee the Dec 30 note for when things will open and be due.\nlooking a bit further ahead, week 2 will be the first half or so of logistic regression. This is long; expect the second half of this to be in week 3.\n\n2024-12-30 12:45: what to expect:\n\nCourse outline. Expect this course to be more about the statistics, taking for granted that you understand well the R stuff we learned in C32.\nMy plans for the course (google sheet), subject to change as we go. There will be a midterm to add once we know when it is. Specifically:\n\nLecture section 1 is on Wed afternoon, lecture section 2 is on Monday afternoon, beginning the week of Jan 6. There is one two-hour lecture a week (with a 10-minute break in the middle).\nThere is no tutorial in this course. Instead, I am expecting you to spend time on your own working through the week’s worksheet. Each worksheet should be available by Monday, and should make sense to you after your lecture for the week.\nWorksheet solutions will be published on Fridays.\nAssignments will open on Fridays and will be due the following Friday night. As in C32, expect there to be eight assignments, best six count. The first assignment will open at the end of week 1 and will be due at the end of week 2.\nThere will be no assignment due close to the midterm date (whenever that is), and so the last assignment will probably be due in the last or second-last week of March.\n\n\n2024-12-09 14:45: Here’s where this year’s news is going to end up. We have a Quercus page. Lectures begin on Wed Jan 8 (section 1) and Mon Jan 6 (section 2). See Acorn for locations and times.\n\n\n\n\n\n2024-04-25 15:00: all done, and grades submitted. They will reach you about two business days after being approved.\n2024-04-25 22:45: 90% done. A little of questions 1 and 2 are all that remain. All being well, grades tomorrow.\n2024-04-24 23:15: 78% done. What’s left is a bit of question 1, all of question 2, and a bit of question 3.\n2024-04-23 23:00: We have all the exams now (there had been a problem with uploading the other exams, but we now have them all). This means that the percent done has actually slipped back to 51% (out of a now larger number of questions to grade), but I’ve had a good day: I am caught up with questions 5 and 6 on all the exams, plus the parts of question 7 I marked yesterday. What remains for me is the last few parts of question 4 for the exams I got today, and the last few parts of question 7 for all the exams. I have worked hard at being consistent between the exams I had and the ones I got today. The course graders are marking questions 1 through 3; expect the marking to be done by about Friday, which would mean grades reaching you on Monday.\n2024-04-22 23:10: I’m now up to 7(c) on the exams I have; what remains is the rest of question 7, the other exams that are coming, and questions 1 to 3 that are being graded by the TAs. We are currently at 53%.\n2024-04-21 23:00: As I said yesterday, I don’t have all the exams scanned yet, but out of the ones I do have, we are now 25% done, and I’m done questions 4 through 5(c). I’m expecting to get the other scans tomorrow, at which point the percentage done will go down before it goes up again, but hopefully taking care of the rest of the questions I’ve already marked some of won’t take too long. My solutions as they stand now.\n2024-04-20 22:55: I spent most of the day marking my share of the final exam in my other course, but I did make some progress on our exam after that; we are now at the grand total of 5%. Not all of the exams are scanned, so I have marked 4(a) and 4(b) on the ones I do have, and will go back and finish those same questions on the other exams when I have them (endeavouring to remember what I did so that I can be consistent).\n2024-04-19 22:00: Most of the exams are scanned, and I plan to start marking over the weekend. Our TAs will also be marking some of it. My solutions, with the Figures at the back.\n2024-04-15 12:00:\n\nAssignment 8 is graded, and I will post the marks shortly. Appeals by usual procedure between April 16 and 19.\nRules for the exam are the same as for all my exams. See note 2024-02-22 11:50 for a guide if you unsure. Expect questions from anywhere in the course, but with an emphasis on stuff that we did in lecture after the midterm.\n\n2024-04-12 15:45: pre-exam office hours on Monday from 11:00am to about 1:00pm, depending how busy things are.\n2024-04-10 17:55: Exam off for printing. It finished up as 7 questions with 40 parts and 87 points (I took a couple of things out). Coverage is everything from the lecture notes except for “durations, intervals, and periods” and also log-linear models as promised. The rules are the same as for the midterm: bring printed material as you wish (organize it or you will run out of time trying to find things), and a non-programmable non-communicating calculator if you wish. There is more explanation than coding (as is usual for this course).\n2024-04-08 21:50: I have had a busy weekend finishing off your exam. In case you are curious:\n\nthere is nothing on log-linear models as promised\nanything else from the course (that appeared in lectures) is fair game, with an emphasis on the material we talked about after the midterm\nthere are currently 7 questions with a total of 42 parts worth a total of 90 points\nI probably will do a fair amount of editing between now and sending it off for printing, but don’t expect the number of parts or points to change much.\n\n2024-04-05 13:20: Assignment 7 is marked, appeals as usual between Apr 7 and 12.\n2024-04-03 21:45: I realized (after thinking about it) that we covered log-linear modelling at too high a speed this afternoon for it to be fair to put a question on that on the final exam (so I won’t). Expect, though, one or both of principal components and factor analysis to make an appearance.\n2024-04-01 12:15: the last Monday update:\n\nI will let you know when assignments 7 and 8 are marked.\nthe last tutorial this afternoon, with something on principal components and something (maybe) on maps.\na note that leaflet maps and pdf don’t go well together (leaflet maps are actually html), so look at the html notes and PASIAS chapter for the stuff on maps.\nlecture this week: the end of principal components, factor analysis, log-linear models. (The last is like regression, but for tables of frequencies. The technique is new, but the ideas should be mainly familiar. I think this is a nice way to end the course.)\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapters 41 and 42. (We are not doing multidimensional scaling this time.)\n\n2024-03-25 10:35: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 8 (the last one!) was due last night.\nTutorial this afternoon, with something on cluster analysis.\nLecture this week: drawing maps, principal components.\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 39. I thought there was a chapter on drawing maps as well; I will have to see what happened to that.\nMy solutions to Assignment 7.\n\n2024-03-22 12:50: Assignment 4 is graded as well, marks coming your way. Appeals as usual between Mar 25 and Apr 1.\n2024-03-21 11:45: Assignments 3 and 5 are graded, and I am about to release the grades. Appeals by usual process between Mar 24 and Mar 31.\n2024-03-18 11:00: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 7 was due last night, and Assignment 8 (the last one) opens tonight.\nTutorial this afternoon on zoom, something on discriminant analysis.\nLecture this week on cluster analysis. (There is another example in the discriminant analysis notes, which you can read if you like.)\nExtra practice problems on cluster analysis: PASIAS chapters 36 and 37.\n\n2024-03-13 16:30: before I forget, from today’s class, loading MASS like this:\n\n\nlibrary(MASS, exclude = \"select\")\n\nloads the whole of MASS except for the one troublesome function select that gets tangled up with the tidyverse select, and if you load MASS this way, you don’t have to worry about the conflicted stuff. (You can also use include to say “load only these functions and no others”, which is in the same spirit as the Python from x import y).\n\n2024-03-13 11:20: my solutions to assignment 6.\n2024-03-11 10:30: Monday update:\n\nThe midterm is marked. Stats: Q1 32 (60%), median 38 (72%), Q3 43 (81%). I will be sharing the marks and the marked midterms shortly. The marks will be on Quercus, and you will be receiving an email from Crowdmark with instructions to see your marked exam.\n\nAppeals are the same procedure as for assignments, between Mar 14 and Mar 21 inclusive. Do not expect me to overrule the grader’s judgment; thus, the only thing worth appealing is an actual grading error, such as an answer where the grader didn’t mark something relevant that you wrote, after consideration of my solutions and any comments on your exam. If you have not received full marks on a question part, you should have received a comment on your exam, or it should be obvious from my solutions what is missing or in error, or both of those things. Your appeal must include a clear description of the grading error (not grading judgment). If you appeal a grading judgment, you run the risk that I regrade your whole exam and your mark may go down as well as up. My philosophy on appeals is similar to that of Jeff Rosenthal.\n\nAssignment 6 was due last night, and is open until Tuesday night (with late penalty). Assignment 7 opens tonight.\nTutorial this afternoon on zoom, with something on repeated measures.\nLecture this week: discriminant analysis, and if we have time, a start on cluster analysis.\nExtra practice problems on this week’s lecture material: PASIAS chapter 35, and Chapter 36 if we get to cluster analysis this week (which I think is unlikely).\n\n2024-03-09 21:30: Up to 89% done on the midterm. The last thing is the marking of question 1, which is happening now. (The grader was invigilating other midterms today.)\n2024-03-08 21:15: We have more exam-marking progress: we are up to 83% done. I have marked my part; we are now waiting on one of the TAs to finish their part. I have been updating my solutions as I’ve been marking. In 5(c), some of you found an answer that I wasn’t expecting but that does answer the question. If that was you, you got full credit for it.\n2024-03-07 22:15: I spent altogether too much of the evening struggling through 4(d), but that is now marked. I have updated my solutions with what I have seen while marking. We are now 61% done.\n2024-03-06 23:00: the midterms are scanned and marking is underway. We are 31% done (some of question 2, and I did most of question 3 until I ran out of juice tonight).\n2024-03-04 11:00: Monday update:\n\nthere is no TA strike. Last night, the university and the TA union came to a “tentative agreement”, which the TAs still have to vote on (so we are not safe yet), but for now there is no strike.\nMy exam solutions.\nexam marking will begin once the exams have been scanned and uploaded to Crowdmark.\ntutorial this afternoon as usual, with some problems on ANCOVA and MANOVA (don’t you love these acronyms?)\nlecture this week: repeated measures, maybe the start of discriminant analysis.\nextra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 34 (repeated measures), 35 (discriminant analysis).\nreminder that Assignment 6 is due on March 10.\n\n2024-03-01 12:20:\n\nmy solutions to Assignment 5\nif you have to miss the midterm, the weight goes automatically onto the final exam. Complete an absence declaration so that there is a record. (added 2024-03-04 11:30: if you already used your absence declaration, I do not need to see any additional documentation, but any other professors affected by your absence might, so be prepared.)\nconversely, if your final exam is better than your midterm, the final exam counts instead of your midterm.\n\n2024-02-26 11:30: Monday update:\n\nMidterm: location and date is on an announcement on Quercus labelled “Midterm”. My reply to that announcement tells you which room you need to be in.\nAssignment 5 was due last night. Assignment 6 opens tonight; you once again have 2 weeks to complete it, so that the midterm and an assignment are not due the same weekend. You may find it useful to start Assignment 6, however, as part of your midterm preparation (the material on it is on the exam).\nTutorial this afternoon. I will find something from the lecture before reading week.\nLecture this week: analysis of covariance (short), multivariate analysis of variance (longer), maybe some of repeated measures.\nIf you have questions as you prepare for the exam, post them on the Quercus discussion board or catch me after lecture.\n\n2024-02-22 11:50:\n\nAs I think I mentioned at the end of the last lecture, coverage for the midterm includes the last lecture before reading week (the “ANOVA revisited” stuff, as much as we saw in class).\nThe midterm has gone for printing. It has five questions, with a total of 23 parts worth 53 points altogether. Expect to be doing more explanation than coding (since the focus of this course is the understanding of the statistics).\nThe exam is open book, same rules as STAC32, and with the same expectation that you will organize your materials before the exam (or else you can expect to run out of time).\nSuggestion: bring a calculator to the exam (an actual calculator, not your phone). You might find it helpful in a couple of places.\nThere will be a lecture next week before the midterm. That material will not be on the midterm, but you can count on it being on the final exam (and it will help you understand what follows in the course).\nre Assignment 2, I have asked the grader to add some explanation to the grading so that you know where you didn’t get full marks. In the meanwhile, compare your answers with my solutions. The same applies to Assignment 3 and Assignment 4 that you don’t have back yet.\n\n2024-02-20 14:00: Assignment 2 is graded, and I am about to post the marks. Appeals by the usual procedure between Feb 23 and Mar 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb1153c55bd1d839d5cfc54d50fe1f522691e8145 - 2024-02-18 22:15: A Sunday night “Monday update”, to remind you that the upcoming week is Reading Week, and there is therefore no tutorial on Monday or lecture on Wednesday. (I will be spending the time sorting out your midterm.) We resume on the 26th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024-02-15 13:30: the midterm is at the end of the first week back after reading week. With that in mind, it seems best to say that we have now covered everything that could appear on the midterm (up to the end of ANOVA Revisited that we did yesterday). The material in between now and the midterm (ANCOVA, MANOVA and possibly some of repeated measures) can certainly appear on the final exam, and provides the foundation for some of the other things we do after that, so you won’t want to miss it.\n2024-02-14 13:30: a couple of things:\n\nMy solutions to Assignment 4\nThe lecture notes for ANOVA Revisited are rather long, and I won’t be talking about all of it. The beginning is review; today, I plan to start with the Rats and Vitamin B example.\n\n2024-02-12 11:25: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 4 was due last night; Assignment 5 opens tonight. You will have two weeks to do Assignment 5, since it is due on Sunday at the end of reading week.\nTutorial this afternoon on Zoom as usual. I will find a survival analysis example from PASIAS to talk about.\nLecture: there is a little more material at the end of the Survival Analysis slides that you would probably do well to look through, but this week I’ll be moving on to ANOVA Revisited. This is followed (probably after reading week) by some other ideas that are based on ANOVA: MANOVA, repeated measures, discriminant analysis and so on.\n\n2024-02-08 10:50: my solutions to assignment 3.\n2024-02-07 20:10: I updated the lecture notes to reflect what I added for class today (the slides “behind the scenes” and the one after that). This now seems to be working for both the .html and the .pdf versions of the slides.\n2024-02-05 15:15: assignment planning: there will be no assignments due during reading week or the weekend of the midterm. That means you’ll get two weeks to do each of Assignment 5 (due the Sunday night at the end of reading week) and Assignment 6 (due March 10). The eighth and final assignment will be due on March 24, so you’ll get a break at the end of the course.\n2024-02-05 11:30: Monday update:\n\nAssignments: #1 is marked, appeals by usual procedure between Feb 8 and 15; #2 is being marked; #3 was due yesterday; #4 opens tonight.\nTutorial on zoom this afternoon as usual (usual link)\nLecture this week: survival analysis. (I’ll decide whether I want to do any more of the dates and times stuff, but I think we have all we need of that.) Content warning on the survival analysis: often the data is on people that will die of something (often cancer), and we will be investigating treatments that will help them live longer, but some of them will die of whatever-it-is. I think that will take up our two hours this week.\n\n2024-02-01 10:30: My solutions to Assignment 2.\n2024-01-29 13:20: Monday update:\n\nTutorial on zoom this afternoon at 4 (link in Quercus announcement)\nAssignments: #2 was due yesterday; #3 opens tonight. I will let you know when #1 is graded.\nLecture this week:\n\nlogistic regression with multi-category but unordered response\ndates and times (in which you learn just how fiddly dates and times are to handle, and how useful it is to have packages that handle them for us)\n\nextra practice problems on this week’s material: PASIAS chapters 29 and 21 (respectively).\n\n2024-01-25 20:30: After Wednesday’s class, I decided that you might like some extra practice on the stuff we did in the first half of class (the log-odds stuff), so I added a short question on that to the next assignment. If that material is still confusing you, we can talk about that on Monday. (It is probably not giving much away to say that the second question on that assignment is on the stuff we did after half-time in class this week.)\n2024-01-25 12:20: my solutions to Assignment 1.\n2024-01-24 11:25: We have a midterm date. See the announcement on Quercus for date, time, and place (not until early March).\n2024-01-22 13:30: upcoming, this week:\n\ntutorial today at 4 on zoom, same coordinates as last week. As I write, Accuweather is telling me “periods of heavy snow for at least 60 minutes”, so I am quite happy to not be travelling today! I plan to pick a problem from PASIAS to talk about, and of course bring other questions if you have them.\nin lecture this week, some or all of:\n\nlog-odds and odds ratios and relative risk (partly in response to last week’s question about what those slope and intercept numbers actually mean)\nlogistic regression with a multi-category response when the response categories are ordered (the coal miners lung disease example)\nlogistic regression with a multi-category response when the response categories are not ordered (the brand preference example)\n\nextra examples: chapters 28 and 29 of PASIAS.\nAssignment 2, on the logistic regression stuff from last week’s lecture, opens tonight and is due next Sunday.\n\n2024-01-17 13:30: practice problems for this week’s material: PASIAS chapter 26 (edited 2024-01-18: we’ll get to chapter 27 next week).\n2024-01-15 11:15: on the agenda this week:\n\ntutorial today at 4:00pm, on zoom (link in Quercus announcement), on the regression stuff we did in lecture last week.\nThe stuff in the slides that I didn’t talk about is regression review. Read through those if you feel you need more review.\nAssignment 1 opens tonight, is due next Sunday night (the 21st), on the stuff we did in lecture last week.\nThis week’s lecture is on logistic regression. The thing that distinguishes this from regular regression is that the response variable is categorical rather than quantitative. There are three parts (that we won’t do all of this week): when the outcome is a success/failure, when the outcome is several categories but ordered, when the outcome is several categories that are not ordered. There are also variations in how the data come to us (and therefore how we have to deal with it).\nNext week’s tutorial (the 22nd) is on the stuff in this week’s lecture, and Assignment 2 (opens on the 22nd and is due on the 28th) is on the same material.\n\n2024-01-11 20:45: we have a Zoom meeting set up for Monday’s tutorial. The coordinates are in a Quercus announcement (I am not announcing it publicly).\n2024-01-11 11:45: Here is a worksheet on the material we looked at in class yesterday. I’m not promising a worksheet every week, but I will point you at some practice problems for each section of the course. Look out for information about Monday’s session tomorrow (once I have sorted that out).\n2024-01-08 12:45: Our course begins this week:\n\nexpect things to be structured a lot like they were in C32.\none two-hour lecture a week, on Wednesdays (I will give you a break in the middle). Your ACORN has the location.\none hour of tutorial-slash-office hour on Mondays, starting next week, probably on zoom. You can also catch me after lecture, or post in the Quercus discussions.\nweekly assignments, with the first one going out on January 15 (out Monday night, due the following Sunday night), in the same style as for C32.\nD29 is more about the statistics and less about the coding than C32 was; you will be learning some statistical methods that are definitely new to you, and I will assume that you are keeping up with the coding part.\n\n2024-01-03 11:00: lecture 1 is a week away:\n\nQuercus page is up (for assignments, discussion board etc)\nbe ready to learn some new statistics (there will be stuff you haven’t seen before)\nI will assume that you are familiar with the R stuff, and the statistical ideas, that you learned in C32. (If you are not, be prepared to do some catching up.)\nwe begin with some new ideas in regression.\nI don’t think there is anyone taking the course as STA 1007 (graduate course) this year; if you are, let me know.\n\n2023-12-12 18:30: a bit more detail:\n\nlectures are once a week on Wednesdays for 2 hours\nthere is a “practical” on Mondays at 4, starting in week 2, probably on zoom. This is a sort of combined office hour / tutorial to which you can bring questions about the previous week’s material.\nweekly assignments (that you are used to from C32), opening Monday night, due the following Sunday night.\na 2-hour midterm and a 3-hour final as usual, on dates to be announced.\n\n2023-12-08 14:30: here is this year’s version of the site.

    "text": "2025-04-19 20:30: we have course grades! I am about to submit them to my department, and then they go through the process I described yesterday.\n\nIf you did not write the final exam, I submit a grade for you with a zero for the work not done, and that is replaced by an “SDF” once your deferred final is approved. Once you write the deferred exam, your course grade is recalculated.\nIf you believe your grade is incorrect, or wish it was different from what it is, the only options you have are the ones described on this page (including the two links at the bottom). Contacting me, or anyone else, about your grade is, you will note, not one of your options.\nWishing everyone an enjoyable summer and, for those graduating this year, I wish you success in whatever your life brings next.\n\n2025-04-18 22:30: it appears that we are now 100% done marking the final exam! Next (as in, not tonight) I look over the marking, and then calculate course grades. The process is, after I calculate and submit the course grades, they are approved by my department, then they go to the Registrar’s office, then, in a day or two after that, they come to you.\n2025-04-17 21:30: progress: up to 70% done, with all of us being busy today.\n2025-04-16 22:45: we are now at 37% done (as I write); both of our TAs have started work on their questions. I have been updating my solutions (link yesterday) with extra things I’m noticing while marking.\n2025-04-15 22:30: a day of marking (for me), so we are now 21% done: that is to say, 8 of the 39 questions are marked. My solutions.\n2025-04-14 23:10: we have scanned exams and grading is under way: that is to say, I have marked two questions, so we are now 5% done.\n2025-04-09 14:30: worksheet 12 solutions are up on the worksheets page. Sorry for the delay: I forgot to post them.\n2025-04-07 13:00:\n\npre-exam office hours on Wednesday April 9, 1:00-3:00pm. I realize that this is the first day of finals, so if you have an afternoon exam that day, there is time to pop in before that.\nyou have until tomorrow (I think it is) to complete a course evaluation, if you have not done so. These are used by my department to assess effectiveness of teaching, so if you have something to say on that, make sure you say it.\n\n2025-04-03 15:45:\n\nthe final exam is about to go for printing. It has 39 questions based on 7 scenarios worth a total of 87 points.\nmy solutions to worksheet 12 are up on the worksheets page.\n\n2025-04-01 16:30 edited 2025-04-02 16:30: Assignments 7 and 8 are marked, and the marks are posted. Any appeals by usual process between Apr 4 and Apr 9 for both (so that I can get them out of the way before the final exam).\n2025-03-28 15:30: Friday update time:\n\none more week to go. Lecture is on multiway frequency tables, as analyzed by log-linear models. I like to end with this because it has a lot in common with regression, so many of the ideas are familiar (though there are one or two that are not).\nsolutions to last week’s worksheet, and a worksheet for the upcoming week are on the worksheets page.\nMore practice problems in PASIAS chapter 42.\nFinal exam is on April 12. I will post an announcement on Quercus with where and exactly when. I will have extra office hours sometime during the week before (thinking probably Wednesday).\n\n2025-03-24 12:20: a couple of notes:\n\nAssignment 8 is closed. My solutions to it are on the assignment solutions page.\nIf your final exam mark is higher than your midterm mark, the final counts instead of the midterm.\n\n2025-03-21 16:00: Friday update:\n\nAssignment 8 and last is due tonight. My solutions to Assignment 7 are up on the assignment solutions page.\nMy solutions to Worksheet 10 are up on the worksheets page.\nNext week’s lectures are on drawing maps and principal components. I don’t think we’ll have time to get to factor analysis this time around, but the ideas there should make sense once we have studied principal components. There is a worksheet 11 up on those.\nPASIAS chapter 38 on maps and chapter 40 on principal components.\n\n2025-03-19 13:20:\n\nthanks to the student who found a discrepancy in the discriminant analysis lecture notes. I went through those notes and the cluster analysis ones (where I feared there would be similar problems), and the versions of those two sets of slides on the lecture notes page should now be correct.\nI think I am now up to date on all the appeals and Quercus discussion board posts.\n\n2025-03-17 10:45: we have midterm marks!\n\nmy solutions\nstats: Q3 52 (78%), median 45.5 (68%), Q1 37 (55%). These are about in line with historical averages for my exams.\nyou will see your mark on Quercus shortly\nyou will get an email from Crowdmark with instructions for accessing your marked exam in it. If you have not earned full marks for a question, you should have a comment from the grader on your marked exam; that, plus a review of my solutions, should help you understand why you did not earn full marks.\nI am happy that the graders have marked consistently and in accordance with my solutions, and therefore I am not allowing appeals of the midterm marks. The marking is, if anything, generous. You should be able to answer any questions about the marking by carefully reading the grader’s comments and carefully reading my solutions.\n\n2025-03-16 20:30: the exam is now at 97% marked, just part of question 14 left.\n2025-03-15 10:45: your TAs had a busy Friday, and we are now all the way to 90% done marking the midterm.\n2025-03-14.159265359: happy pi day!\n\nMidterm marking is now 60% done.\nLectures next week are on cluster analysis. I think we are on course to finish everything: maps (maybe) and principal components the week after next, multiway frequency tables in the last week. (Yes, we are that near the end.)\nPASIAS for cluster analysis: chapters 36 and 37.\nAssignments: assignment 7 is due tonight; assignment 8 opens today and is due on Mar 21.\nAssignment 8 is based on worksheets 8 and 9. There is also a worksheet 10, which is on the worksheets page, along with solutions to worksheet 9.\nNow I need to get back to marking exams!\n\n2025-03-13 21:15: we are past halfway, 55% done as I write.\n2025-03-12 22:00: there is a limit to how much exam marking I can do on a lecture day, and I have reached it. Exam is 40% marked.\n2025-03-11 22:30: midterm is 25% marked, and I am out of juice.\n2025-03-11 11:45:\n\nassignment 6 is marked, grades being posted shortly. Appeals by usual procedure between Mar 14 and 21 inclusive.\nI have looked at all the appeals for assignment 3. The other appeals will have to wait until I have finished marking my share of the midterms.\nas of right now, we are 10% done marking the midterms (I have marked two more questions this morning).\n\n2025-03-10 23:00: The exams are scanned and on Crowdmark. We are now at the dizzying heights of 3% done (meaning, I have marked one question). I was going to do a second one tonight, but I ran out of juice. Tomorrow, I am hoping to make some decent progress.\n2025-03-08 13:30: the update turned out to be so late that it is now Saturday!\n\nThe midterm will be scanned on (probably) Monday, and marking will begin after that. I may not have much time this coming week outside of lectures because I will be marking my share of your midterm.\nNow that you have written the exam, you can get back to the repeated measures material. There is a worksheet 8 on the worksheets page about that; the answers are also up. (There is also a worksheet 9 on the upcoming week’s material.)\nNext week’s lecture is on discriminant analysis. This is the natural followup to MANOVA; you’ll remember that MANOVA doesn’t tell us much beyond “there is something going on”, and discriminant analysis will help you discover what the “something” is.\nAssignment 7 is due on March 14. Assignment 8 opens on that day, and is due on March 21. Assignment 8 is on the material in worksheets 8 and 9. There are no more assignments after that. (I appreciate that you may have term papers and the like that are due at the end of classes, and I don’t want to be part of that problem.) There will be worksheets the rest of the way to help you practice what you have learned.\nIf you want extra practice, PASIAS is the place to look:\n\nChapter 33 is MANOVA\nChapter 34 is repeated measures\nChapter 35 is discriminant analysis.\n\n\n2025-03-07 17:30: A very late Friday update (which I will add to later):\n\nMidterm exam tonight! See the Quercus announcement for place and time (we are in two rooms, so make sure you are in the correct one). If you miss the midterm for any reason, the weight goes onto the final exam. I do not need documentation for this.\n\n2025-03-05 17:00: Assignment 6 solutions are up on the assignment solution page.\n2025-03-05 13:10: I have just updated the MANOVA and repeated measures lecture notes:\n\nthere was a question on Monday about Box’s M test for interactions (in the peanuts example). I have added a little about this to the lecture notes, and put a more detailed answer on the Quercus discussion board.\nI fitted the mixed model (for the dogs) wrong in repeated measures. I used time (quantitative) in my model, which assumes a linear relationship with time. This is not what I wanted; I wanted to see whether there was any relationship with time (or any interaction between time and drug), so the right way is to treat time as categorical, which is done using the “temporary” column I called timex. The results from the mixed model are now more or less consistent with the MANOVA approach, which is how it should be.\nThe revised slides (for both) are now on the lecture notes page.\nI will (hopefully) give the Monday folks a brief summary next week of what changed. However, you may need to remind me, because this is exactly the kind of thing I tend to forget!\n\n2025-02-28 11:10 with additions 2025-03-03 11:15: Friday update (back to the usual day this week):\n\nreminder of midterm on Mar 7:\n\nSee Quercus announcement for time, place, and details. One thing I forgot to mention: the rules for the exams in this course are the same as for STAC32: bring any printed material you like, but make sure it’s organized, or else you will waste too much time looking things up.\nmaterial on the midterm is everything up to and including last week’s lecture. Last week’s (Thursday) update will tell you what that is.\nthe midterm has gone for printing. It has 6 scenarios with 30 questions total, worth a total of 67 marks.\n(added 2025-03-03 11:15) other exam rules for this course are the same as for STAC32. In particular, if you miss the midterm (for any reason), the weight is transferred to the final exam.\n\nAssignments:\n\nAssignment 4 is graded, and the marks will be posted shortly. (Added 2025-03-03 11:15: I forgot to post the marks, but they are posted now.) Appeals by usual procedure between Mar 5 and Mar 12.\nAssignment 6 is due tonight and is open until Sunday night (with late penalty).\nAssignment 7 (on the same material as Worksheet 7) will open today, but is not due until Mar 14. You may want to start work on it to help you prepare for the midterm.\nI deal with appeals at the end of the date range for each assignment, so that I can look at them all together.\n\nLecture next week:\n\nthe remainder of MANOVA (quickly, since there are only a few new ideas in the second example)\nrepeated measures\n\nWorksheets:\n\nMy solutions to worksheet 7 are up on the worksheets page.\nWorksheet 8 is also up on the worksheets page.\n\n\n2025-02-26 10:30: if you are appealing an assignment mark, you need to note the dates between which appeals are accepted: starting tomorrow for Assignment 3, starting Friday for Assignment 5. Any appeals already submitted for these assignments are too early, and will need to be re-submitted at the right time.\n2025-02-25 14:20: assignment 5 is graded. Appeals between Feb 28 and Mar 7 by the usual process, which is:\n\nsend me an email with the word “appeal” and the course and assignment number in the subject header between the appropriate dates\nexplain precisely which question on the assignment has been incorrectly graded according to my solutions/the rubric, and how your answer is correct.\n“my answer is the same as the solutions” is not persuasive, because the grader clearly thought it was not.\nthe appeal process is for correcting errors. I will not overturn a grader’s judgement (eg. about part marks).\n\n2025-02-24 10:35: Assignments:\n\nAssignment 3 is graded. Any appeals between Feb 27 and Mar 6 inclusive by the usual process.\nAssignment 4 and 5 grading is under way.\nAssignment 6 is open, and is due on Friday (Feb 28).\n\n2025-02-20 14:20: we appear to have a Thursday update this week:\n\nAssignment 6 is due on Feb 28 (Friday of the first week back after reading week)\nMy solutions to Assignments 4 and 5 are up on the assignment solutions page.\nGrading of Assignments 3 and 4 is under way.\nNext week’s lecture is on some or all of these, in this order:\n\ncontrasts (at the end of the ANOVA Revisited slides)\nanalysis of covariance\nmultivariate analysis of variance with link to discussion of Box M test\n\nWhatever of these we get to is on the midterm; anything we don’t (which might be some of MANOVA) is not. There is a lecture the week of Mar 3, scheduled to be on repeated measures. This will not be on the midterm, but will be on the final exam (you can count on it), so miss it at your peril!\nIt is up to you to organize your own review for the midterm. I have twelve weeks of material to share with you, so we need to keep going.\nThe current draft of the midterm has 6 scenarios with a total of 30 questions, but that may change between now and the midterm date.\nThere is a Worksheet 7 up on the Worksheets page, which is on the material in next week’s lecture.\nLooking ahead, Assignment 7 is not due until Mar 14 (so that you don’t have an assignment due the same day as the midterm), but starting it early will help you prepare for the midterm. It will open on Feb 28.\n\n2025-02-14 11:45: Friday update:\n\nnext week is reading week! No lectures on Mon/Wed and no assignment due on Friday of reading week.\nAssignment 5 is due tonight (open until Sun with late penalty).\nWorksheet 6 solutions are up on the worksheets page.\nAssignment 6, on this week’s material, is open but is not due until Feb 28.\nWhen we come back from reading week, the Feb 24/26 lecture will be on some or all of:\n\ncontrasts (at the end of the ANOVA Revisited slides)\nanalysis of covariance\nmultivariate analysis of variance\n\nHave a happy Family Day!\n\n2025-02-11 16:30: weather forecast is calling for a snowstorm right after lecture ends tomorrow. Check the university status page to make sure that campus is open before you head in. If campus is closed there is, of course, no lecture, but if campus is open and the snowstorm is imminent, my contingency plan is to do lecture without a break and end early so that you can get home.\n\nEdit 2025-02-12 12:30: contingency plan applies: we’ll go without a break and finish before 3:30 today. No office hours today, since I want to get home too! Catch me after class or post on the quercus discussion board if you have questions.\n\n2025-02-07 15:30: a late Friday update this week, because I have been marking deferred exams:\n\nLecture next week is ANOVA revisited, including two-way ANOVA, interactions, simple effects, contrasts and the like.\nOn the worksheets page, solutions to worksheet 5 and questions for worksheet 6 (on the ANOVA stuff).\nFor extra practice on this material, see PASIAS chapter 31.\nAssignment 4 is due tonight, and Assignment 5 is open.\nLooking ahead a bit, Feb 17-21 is reading week; there are no lectures that week, and no assignment is due. (Assignment 5 is due just before reading week, and assignment 6 will not be due until the end of the week after reading week, ie. Feb 28). There will also be no assignment due the day of the midterm, and after that the worksheets and assignments will probably be out of sync number-wise.\n\n2025-02-06 20:45: worksheet 5 solutions are up on the worksheets page. Assignment 5 opens at midnight.\n2025-02-03 15:15: On Assignment 4 question 5, if you cannot get step to work for you without giving an error message: show the error message in the work you hand in (you will probably also need to add #| error: true as the top line of the code chunk in question), and then proceed in question 6 as if the best model has bill length, bill depth, and sex in it (if step does not work for you, you will need to explicitly fit this model in order to obtain predictions later).\n2025-02-03 12:15: Assignment update:\n\nAssignment 4 is open.\nAssignment 3 is closed and solutions are posted on the assignment solutions page.\nAssignment 2 is marked. Appeals by usual process between Feb 6 and Feb 13 inclusive.\n\n2025-01-31 14:30: Friday update:\n\nMidterm date, time, and place is official. See the announcement on Quercus for details. (I am not sharing details with anyone outside the class, for your safety.) Material is probably up to the week before the midterm, but it is too soon to say specifically what that will be.\nLecture next week on survival analysis.\nWorksheet 4 solutions and worksheet 5 questions are up on the worksheets page.\nFor extra practice on survival analysis, see Chapter 30 of PASIAS.\nAssignment 3 is due tonight (open until Sunday night), and assignment 4 is open now.\n\n2025-01-27 11:00: Assignment 2 is closed. My solutions are on the assignment solutions page. The cold is improving, though I still have a cough. Assignment 3 is open.\n2025-01-24 14:30: Friday update:\n\nwe have a tentative midterm date of March 7. I will let you know when this is official, though it is not likely to change.\nnext week’s lectures on:\n\nthe rest of logistic regression, that is to say the odds and ends at the end of the brand-preference example.\ndates and times, possibly also including durations, intervals, and periods.\nThe reason for looking at dates and times now is to prepare us for survival analysis, which is the study of the time until an event happens.\n\nworksheets, on the worksheets page:\n\nsolutions to #3 are up (thanks to the student who reminded me)\nworksheet #4 is up, which will make sense after next week’s lecture (though in fact you may be able to do some of it now).\n\nassignments:\n\n#2 due tonight, open until Sunday night\n#3 opened today, and is due on Friday of next week. Reminder that each assignment is based on the worksheet with the same number.\n\n\n2025-01-23 15:30: Assignment 1 is graded, and I am about to release the marks. Appeals by the same procedure as STAC32 between Jan 26 and Feb 2 inclusive: that is to say, for your appeal to be successful, you will have to demonstrate that your work was graded inconsistently with my solutions and the rubric (see next sentence). This time, the grader created a rubric that you can see, which will also help to explain why you earned the mark you did (as well as making the grading quicker and more consistent).\n2025-01-22 11:55: my cold continues. I did about 90 minutes of class on Monday before running out of energy, and I expect today to be about the same. On Monday, I went more or less straight home after class and took a nap, and I may need to do the same today. So, don’t count on finding me in my office after class today; if you have questions, ask me after lecture, or put them on the Quercus discussion board.\n2025-01-20 11:35:\n\nI have a cold. Try not to get too close to me this week. I feel as if I am running at half speed. Anyway, we will get to where we get. If I am out of juice, we may end early this week. Curiously, the material on worksheet 3 and assignment 3 is only about the first half of what I was planning to do this week, so it is actually OK if we don’t get as far as I had originally planned.\nSolutions to Assignment 1 (which is now closed) are on the assignment solutions page.\n\n2025-01-17 14:20: we appear to be on a Friday update this week. To add to the earlier reminders:\n\nworksheet 2 solutions on the worksheets page; assignment 2 opens today.\nnext week’s lecture on the second half of logistic regression, starting with the coal-miners example. There is some stuff about odds ratios and relative risk that I may or may not talk about; also, my recollection is that the second half of logistic regression takes a while to work through because there is a fair bit of detail. There is a worksheet 3 already up on this stuff; for further examples and practice, see PASIAS chapter 28 (also, maybe chapter 29, depending on how far we get).\n\n2025-01-13 11:15: some reminders:\n\nworksheet 1 solutions are on the worksheets page.\nassignment 1 is open, due on Friday (Jan 17) on the same material as Worksheet 1. My solutions to it will go up after it closes.\nthis week’s lecture on logistic regression, up until about the stuff on odds and log-odds.\nworksheet 2 is on the worksheets page, and should make sense after this week’s lecture. My solutions to it will go up on the same page towards the end of the week.\nmore practice problems in PASIAS chapter 27.\nassignment 2 will open on Friday Jan 17 and will be due on Friday Jan 24.\n\n2025-01-09 12:20: it feels rather strange to say that week 1 is done, but for me it is. A couple of reminders:\n\nworksheet 1, on the worksheets page, is available for practice on the stuff we did in class this week. I will post my solutions in the same place tonight (if I remember) or tomorrow (if I don’t). (If the worksheets display in an odd order, use the pulldown above the list of files to display them in file name order.)\nassigment 1, on Quercus, opens tomorrow and is due on Jan 17 (at 11:59pm).\nnext week’s lecture: approximately the first half of logistic regression.\n\n2025-01-05 20:00: Sunday update (not sure yet whether this will be a regular thing):\n\nclasses start Monday (section 2), Wednesday (section 1), place and time in Acorn\nthis week, course outline that is very similar to C32’s, some multiple regression stuff that is partly review and partly some new ideas. Some of the more review-y stuff I will speed through or skip depending how we’re doing for time.\nthere is a worksheets page that has the questions for a Worksheet 1 that will make sense after this week’s class.\nsee the Dec 30 note for when things will open and be due.\nlooking a bit further ahead, week 2 will be the first half or so of logistic regression. This is long; expect the second half of this to be in week 3.\n\n2024-12-30 12:45: what to expect:\n\nCourse outline. Expect this course to be more about the statistics, taking for granted that you understand well the R stuff we learned in C32.\nMy plans for the course (google sheet), subject to change as we go. There will be a midterm to add once we know when it is. Specifically:\n\nLecture section 1 is on Wed afternoon, lecture section 2 is on Monday afternoon, beginning the week of Jan 6. There is one two-hour lecture a week (with a 10-minute break in the middle).\nThere is no tutorial in this course. Instead, I am expecting you to spend time on your own working through the week’s worksheet. Each worksheet should be available by Monday, and should make sense to you after your lecture for the week.\nWorksheet solutions will be published on Fridays.\nAssignments will open on Fridays and will be due the following Friday night. As in C32, expect there to be eight assignments, best six count. The first assignment will open at the end of week 1 and will be due at the end of week 2.\nThere will be no assignment due close to the midterm date (whenever that is), and so the last assignment will probably be due in the last or second-last week of March.\n\n\n2024-12-09 14:45: Here’s where this year’s news is going to end up. We have a Quercus page. Lectures begin on Wed Jan 8 (section 1) and Mon Jan 6 (section 2). See Acorn for locations and times.",

    "text": "2024-04-25 15:00: all done, and grades submitted. They will reach you about two business days after being approved.\n2024-04-25 22:45: 90% done. A little of questions 1 and 2 are all that remain. All being well, grades tomorrow.\n2024-04-24 23:15: 78% done. What’s left is a bit of question 1, all of question 2, and a bit of question 3.\n2024-04-23 23:00: We have all the exams now (there had been a problem with uploading the other exams, but we now have them all). This means that the percent done has actually slipped back to 51% (out of a now larger number of questions to grade), but I’ve had a good day: I am caught up with questions 5 and 6 on all the exams, plus the parts of question 7 I marked yesterday. What remains for me is the last few parts of question 4 for the exams I got today, and the last few parts of question 7 for all the exams. I have worked hard at being consistent between the exams I had and the ones I got today. The course graders are marking questions 1 through 3; expect the marking to be done by about Friday, which would mean grades reaching you on Monday.\n2024-04-22 23:10: I’m now up to 7(c) on the exams I have; what remains is the rest of question 7, the other exams that are coming, and questions 1 to 3 that are being graded by the TAs. We are currently at 53%.\n2024-04-21 23:00: As I said yesterday, I don’t have all the exams scanned yet, but out of the ones I do have, we are now 25% done, and I’m done questions 4 through 5(c). I’m expecting to get the other scans tomorrow, at which point the percentage done will go down before it goes up again, but hopefully taking care of the rest of the questions I’ve already marked some of won’t take too long. My solutions as they stand now.\n2024-04-20 22:55: I spent most of the day marking my share of the final exam in my other course, but I did make some progress on our exam after that; we are now at the grand total of 5%. Not all of the exams are scanned, so I have marked 4(a) and 4(b) on the ones I do have, and will go back and finish those same questions on the other exams when I have them (endeavouring to remember what I did so that I can be consistent).\n2024-04-19 22:00: Most of the exams are scanned, and I plan to start marking over the weekend. Our TAs will also be marking some of it. My solutions, with the Figures at the back.\n2024-04-15 12:00:\n\nAssignment 8 is graded, and I will post the marks shortly. Appeals by usual procedure between April 16 and 19.\nRules for the exam are the same as for all my exams. See note 2024-02-22 11:50 for a guide if you unsure. Expect questions from anywhere in the course, but with an emphasis on stuff that we did in lecture after the midterm.\n\n2024-04-12 15:45: pre-exam office hours on Monday from 11:00am to about 1:00pm, depending how busy things are.\n2024-04-10 17:55: Exam off for printing. It finished up as 7 questions with 40 parts and 87 points (I took a couple of things out). Coverage is everything from the lecture notes except for “durations, intervals, and periods” and also log-linear models as promised. The rules are the same as for the midterm: bring printed material as you wish (organize it or you will run out of time trying to find things), and a non-programmable non-communicating calculator if you wish. There is more explanation than coding (as is usual for this course).\n2024-04-08 21:50: I have had a busy weekend finishing off your exam. In case you are curious:\n\nthere is nothing on log-linear models as promised\nanything else from the course (that appeared in lectures) is fair game, with an emphasis on the material we talked about after the midterm\nthere are currently 7 questions with a total of 42 parts worth a total of 90 points\nI probably will do a fair amount of editing between now and sending it off for printing, but don’t expect the number of parts or points to change much.\n\n2024-04-05 13:20: Assignment 7 is marked, appeals as usual between Apr 7 and 12.\n2024-04-03 21:45: I realized (after thinking about it) that we covered log-linear modelling at too high a speed this afternoon for it to be fair to put a question on that on the final exam (so I won’t). Expect, though, one or both of principal components and factor analysis to make an appearance.\n2024-04-01 12:15: the last Monday update:\n\nI will let you know when assignments 7 and 8 are marked.\nthe last tutorial this afternoon, with something on principal components and something (maybe) on maps.\na note that leaflet maps and pdf don’t go well together (leaflet maps are actually html), so look at the html notes and PASIAS chapter for the stuff on maps.\nlecture this week: the end of principal components, factor analysis, log-linear models. (The last is like regression, but for tables of frequencies. The technique is new, but the ideas should be mainly familiar. I think this is a nice way to end the course.)\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapters 41 and 42. (We are not doing multidimensional scaling this time.)\n\n2024-03-25 10:35: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 8 (the last one!) was due last night.\nTutorial this afternoon, with something on cluster analysis.\nLecture this week: drawing maps, principal components.\nExtra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 39. I thought there was a chapter on drawing maps as well; I will have to see what happened to that.\nMy solutions to Assignment 7.\n\n2024-03-22 12:50: Assignment 4 is graded as well, marks coming your way. Appeals as usual between Mar 25 and Apr 1.\n2024-03-21 11:45: Assignments 3 and 5 are graded, and I am about to release the grades. Appeals by usual process between Mar 24 and Mar 31.\n2024-03-18 11:00: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 7 was due last night, and Assignment 8 (the last one) opens tonight.\nTutorial this afternoon on zoom, something on discriminant analysis.\nLecture this week on cluster analysis. (There is another example in the discriminant analysis notes, which you can read if you like.)\nExtra practice problems on cluster analysis: PASIAS chapters 36 and 37.\n\n2024-03-13 16:30: before I forget, from today’s class, loading MASS like this:\n\n\nlibrary(MASS, exclude = \"select\")\n\nloads the whole of MASS except for the one troublesome function select that gets tangled up with the tidyverse select, and if you load MASS this way, you don’t have to worry about the conflicted stuff. (You can also use include to say “load only these functions and no others”, which is in the same spirit as the Python from x import y).\n\n2024-03-13 11:20: my solutions to assignment 6.\n2024-03-11 10:30: Monday update:\n\nThe midterm is marked. Stats: Q1 32 (60%), median 38 (72%), Q3 43 (81%). I will be sharing the marks and the marked midterms shortly. The marks will be on Quercus, and you will be receiving an email from Crowdmark with instructions to see your marked exam.\n\nAppeals are the same procedure as for assignments, between Mar 14 and Mar 21 inclusive. Do not expect me to overrule the grader’s judgment; thus, the only thing worth appealing is an actual grading error, such as an answer where the grader didn’t mark something relevant that you wrote, after consideration of my solutions and any comments on your exam. If you have not received full marks on a question part, you should have received a comment on your exam, or it should be obvious from my solutions what is missing or in error, or both of those things. Your appeal must include a clear description of the grading error (not grading judgment). If you appeal a grading judgment, you run the risk that I regrade your whole exam and your mark may go down as well as up. My philosophy on appeals is similar to that of Jeff Rosenthal.\n\nAssignment 6 was due last night, and is open until Tuesday night (with late penalty). Assignment 7 opens tonight.\nTutorial this afternoon on zoom, with something on repeated measures.\nLecture this week: discriminant analysis, and if we have time, a start on cluster analysis.\nExtra practice problems on this week’s lecture material: PASIAS chapter 35, and Chapter 36 if we get to cluster analysis this week (which I think is unlikely).\n\n2024-03-09 21:30: Up to 89% done on the midterm. The last thing is the marking of question 1, which is happening now. (The grader was invigilating other midterms today.)\n2024-03-08 21:15: We have more exam-marking progress: we are up to 83% done. I have marked my part; we are now waiting on one of the TAs to finish their part. I have been updating my solutions as I’ve been marking. In 5(c), some of you found an answer that I wasn’t expecting but that does answer the question. If that was you, you got full credit for it.\n2024-03-07 22:15: I spent altogether too much of the evening struggling through 4(d), but that is now marked. I have updated my solutions with what I have seen while marking. We are now 61% done.\n2024-03-06 23:00: the midterms are scanned and marking is underway. We are 31% done (some of question 2, and I did most of question 3 until I ran out of juice tonight).\n2024-03-04 11:00: Monday update:\n\nthere is no TA strike. Last night, the university and the TA union came to a “tentative agreement”, which the TAs still have to vote on (so we are not safe yet), but for now there is no strike.\nMy exam solutions.\nexam marking will begin once the exams have been scanned and uploaded to Crowdmark.\ntutorial this afternoon as usual, with some problems on ANCOVA and MANOVA (don’t you love these acronyms?)\nlecture this week: repeated measures, maybe the start of discriminant analysis.\nextra practice problems: PASIAS chapter 34 (repeated measures), 35 (discriminant analysis).\nreminder that Assignment 6 is due on March 10.\n\n2024-03-01 12:20:\n\nmy solutions to Assignment 5\nif you have to miss the midterm, the weight goes automatically onto the final exam. Complete an absence declaration so that there is a record. (added 2024-03-04 11:30: if you already used your absence declaration, I do not need to see any additional documentation, but any other professors affected by your absence might, so be prepared.)\nconversely, if your final exam is better than your midterm, the final exam counts instead of your midterm.\n\n2024-02-26 11:30: Monday update:\n\nMidterm: location and date is on an announcement on Quercus labelled “Midterm”. My reply to that announcement tells you which room you need to be in.\nAssignment 5 was due last night. Assignment 6 opens tonight; you once again have 2 weeks to complete it, so that the midterm and an assignment are not due the same weekend. You may find it useful to start Assignment 6, however, as part of your midterm preparation (the material on it is on the exam).\nTutorial this afternoon. I will find something from the lecture before reading week.\nLecture this week: analysis of covariance (short), multivariate analysis of variance (longer), maybe some of repeated measures.\nIf you have questions as you prepare for the exam, post them on the Quercus discussion board or catch me after lecture.\n\n2024-02-22 11:50:\n\nAs I think I mentioned at the end of the last lecture, coverage for the midterm includes the last lecture before reading week (the “ANOVA revisited” stuff, as much as we saw in class).\nThe midterm has gone for printing. It has five questions, with a total of 23 parts worth 53 points altogether. Expect to be doing more explanation than coding (since the focus of this course is the understanding of the statistics).\nThe exam is open book, same rules as STAC32, and with the same expectation that you will organize your materials before the exam (or else you can expect to run out of time).\nSuggestion: bring a calculator to the exam (an actual calculator, not your phone). You might find it helpful in a couple of places.\nThere will be a lecture next week before the midterm. That material will not be on the midterm, but you can count on it being on the final exam (and it will help you understand what follows in the course).\nre Assignment 2, I have asked the grader to add some explanation to the grading so that you know where you didn’t get full marks. In the meanwhile, compare your answers with my solutions. The same applies to Assignment 3 and Assignment 4 that you don’t have back yet.\n\n2024-02-20 14:00: Assignment 2 is graded, and I am about to post the marks. Appeals by the usual procedure between Feb 23 and Mar 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb1153c55bd1d839d5cfc54d50fe1f522691e8145 - 2024-02-18 22:15: A Sunday night “Monday update”, to remind you that the upcoming week is Reading Week, and there is therefore no tutorial on Monday or lecture on Wednesday. (I will be spending the time sorting out your midterm.) We resume on the 26th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024-02-15 13:30: the midterm is at the end of the first week back after reading week. With that in mind, it seems best to say that we have now covered everything that could appear on the midterm (up to the end of ANOVA Revisited that we did yesterday). The material in between now and the midterm (ANCOVA, MANOVA and possibly some of repeated measures) can certainly appear on the final exam, and provides the foundation for some of the other things we do after that, so you won’t want to miss it.\n2024-02-14 13:30: a couple of things:\n\nMy solutions to Assignment 4\nThe lecture notes for ANOVA Revisited are rather long, and I won’t be talking about all of it. The beginning is review; today, I plan to start with the Rats and Vitamin B example.\n\n2024-02-12 11:25: Monday update:\n\nAssignment 4 was due last night; Assignment 5 opens tonight. You will have two weeks to do Assignment 5, since it is due on Sunday at the end of reading week.\nTutorial this afternoon on Zoom as usual. I will find a survival analysis example from PASIAS to talk about.\nLecture: there is a little more material at the end of the Survival Analysis slides that you would probably do well to look through, but this week I’ll be moving on to ANOVA Revisited. This is followed (probably after reading week) by some other ideas that are based on ANOVA: MANOVA, repeated measures, discriminant analysis and so on.\n\n2024-02-08 10:50: my solutions to assignment 3.\n2024-02-07 20:10: I updated the lecture notes to reflect what I added for class today (the slides “behind the scenes” and the one after that). This now seems to be working for both the .html and the .pdf versions of the slides.\n2024-02-05 15:15: assignment planning: there will be no assignments due during reading week or the weekend of the midterm. That means you’ll get two weeks to do each of Assignment 5 (due the Sunday night at the end of reading week) and Assignment 6 (due March 10). The eighth and final assignment will be due on March 24, so you’ll get a break at the end of the course.\n2024-02-05 11:30: Monday update:\n\nAssignments: #1 is marked, appeals by usual procedure between Feb 8 and 15; #2 is being marked; #3 was due yesterday; #4 opens tonight.\nTutorial on zoom this afternoon as usual (usual link)\nLecture this week: survival analysis. (I’ll decide whether I want to do any more of the dates and times stuff, but I think we have all we need of that.) Content warning on the survival analysis: often the data is on people that will die of something (often cancer), and we will be investigating treatments that will help them live longer, but some of them will die of whatever-it-is. I think that will take up our two hours this week.\n\n2024-02-01 10:30: My solutions to Assignment 2.\n2024-01-29 13:20: Monday update:\n\nTutorial on zoom this afternoon at 4 (link in Quercus announcement)\nAssignments: #2 was due yesterday; #3 opens tonight. I will let you know when #1 is graded.\nLecture this week:\n\nlogistic regression with multi-category but unordered response\ndates and times (in which you learn just how fiddly dates and times are to handle, and how useful it is to have packages that handle them for us)\n\nextra practice problems on this week’s material: PASIAS chapters 29 and 21 (respectively).\n\n2024-01-25 20:30: After Wednesday’s class, I decided that you might like some extra practice on the stuff we did in the first half of class (the log-odds stuff), so I added a short question on that to the next assignment. If that material is still confusing you, we can talk about that on Monday. (It is probably not giving much away to say that the second question on that assignment is on the stuff we did after half-time in class this week.)\n2024-01-25 12:20: my solutions to Assignment 1.\n2024-01-24 11:25: We have a midterm date. See the announcement on Quercus for date, time, and place (not until early March).\n2024-01-22 13:30: upcoming, this week:\n\ntutorial today at 4 on zoom, same coordinates as last week. As I write, Accuweather is telling me “periods of heavy snow for at least 60 minutes”, so I am quite happy to not be travelling today! I plan to pick a problem from PASIAS to talk about, and of course bring other questions if you have them.\nin lecture this week, some or all of:\n\nlog-odds and odds ratios and relative risk (partly in response to last week’s question about what those slope and intercept numbers actually mean)\nlogistic regression with a multi-category response when the response categories are ordered (the coal miners lung disease example)\nlogistic regression with a multi-category response when the response categories are not ordered (the brand preference example)\n\nextra examples: chapters 28 and 29 of PASIAS.\nAssignment 2, on the logistic regression stuff from last week’s lecture, opens tonight and is due next Sunday.\n\n2024-01-17 13:30: practice problems for this week’s material: PASIAS chapter 26 (edited 2024-01-18: we’ll get to chapter 27 next week).\n2024-01-15 11:15: on the agenda this week:\n\ntutorial today at 4:00pm, on zoom (link in Quercus announcement), on the regression stuff we did in lecture last week.\nThe stuff in the slides that I didn’t talk about is regression review. Read through those if you feel you need more review.\nAssignment 1 opens tonight, is due next Sunday night (the 21st), on the stuff we did in lecture last week.\nThis week’s lecture is on logistic regression. The thing that distinguishes this from regular regression is that the response variable is categorical rather than quantitative. There are three parts (that we won’t do all of this week): when the outcome is a success/failure, when the outcome is several categories but ordered, when the outcome is several categories that are not ordered. There are also variations in how the data come to us (and therefore how we have to deal with it).\nNext week’s tutorial (the 22nd) is on the stuff in this week’s lecture, and Assignment 2 (opens on the 22nd and is due on the 28th) is on the same material.\n\n2024-01-11 20:45: we have a Zoom meeting set up for Monday’s tutorial. The coordinates are in a Quercus announcement (I am not announcing it publicly).\n2024-01-11 11:45: Here is a worksheet on the material we looked at in class yesterday. I’m not promising a worksheet every week, but I will point you at some practice problems for each section of the course. Look out for information about Monday’s session tomorrow (once I have sorted that out).\n2024-01-08 12:45: Our course begins this week:\n\nexpect things to be structured a lot like they were in C32.\none two-hour lecture a week, on Wednesdays (I will give you a break in the middle). Your ACORN has the location.\none hour of tutorial-slash-office hour on Mondays, starting next week, probably on zoom. You can also catch me after lecture, or post in the Quercus discussions.\nweekly assignments, with the first one going out on January 15 (out Monday night, due the following Sunday night), in the same style as for C32.\nD29 is more about the statistics and less about the coding than C32 was; you will be learning some statistical methods that are definitely new to you, and I will assume that you are keeping up with the coding part.\n\n2024-01-03 11:00: lecture 1 is a week away:\n\nQuercus page is up (for assignments, discussion board etc)\nbe ready to learn some new statistics (there will be stuff you haven’t seen before)\nI will assume that you are familiar with the R stuff, and the statistical ideas, that you learned in C32. (If you are not, be prepared to do some catching up.)\nwe begin with some new ideas in regression.\nI don’t think there is anyone taking the course as STA 1007 (graduate course) this year; if you are, let me know.\n\n2023-12-12 18:30: a bit more detail:\n\nlectures are once a week on Wednesdays for 2 hours\nthere is a “practical” on Mondays at 4, starting in week 2, probably on zoom. This is a sort of combined office hour / tutorial to which you can bring questions about the previous week’s material.\nweekly assignments (that you are used to from C32), opening Monday night, due the following Sunday night.\na 2-hour midterm and a 3-hour final as usual, on dates to be announced.\n\n2023-12-08 14:30: here is this year’s version of the site. Class meets once a week for two hours, starting on Wed January 10, 2024.",
