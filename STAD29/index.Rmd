Welcome to the home page for STA 1007 / STAD29. This is the place to look for things course-related (notes, code, old exams etc., linked above) except for lecture videos, assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca).


## News (newest first)

- 2024-01-25 12:20: [my solutions](a1-d29-2024.html) to Assignment 1.

- 2024-01-24 11:25: We have a midterm date. See the announcement on Quercus for date, time, and place (not until early March).


- 2024-01-22 13:30: upcoming, this week:
  - tutorial today at 4 on zoom, same coordinates as last week. As I write, Accuweather is telling me "periods of heavy snow for at least 60 minutes", so I am quite happy to not be travelling today! I plan to pick a problem from [PASIAS](https://ritsokiguess.site/pasias2/logistic-regression.html) to talk about, and of course bring other questions if you have them.
  - in lecture this week, some or all of:
    - log-odds and odds ratios and relative risk (partly in response to last week's question about what those slope and intercept numbers actually *mean*)
    - logistic regression with a multi-category response when the response categories are ordered (the coal miners lung disease example)
    - logistic regression with a multi-category response when the response categories are *not* ordered (the brand preference example)
  - extra examples: chapters 28 and 29 of PASIAS.
  - Assignment 2, on the logistic regression stuff from last week's lecture, opens tonight and is due next Sunday.

- 2024-01-17 13:30: practice problems for this week's material: [PASIAS](https://ritsokiguess.site/pasias/) chapter 26 (edited 2024-01-18: we'll get to chapter 27 next week).


- 2024-01-15 11:15: on the agenda this week:
  - tutorial today at 4:00pm, on zoom (link in Quercus announcement), on the regression stuff we did in lecture last week.
  - The stuff in the slides that I didn't talk about is regression review. Read through those if you feel you need more review.
  - Assignment 1 opens tonight, is due next Sunday night (the 21st), on the stuff we did in lecture last week.
  - This week's lecture is on logistic regression. The thing that distinguishes this from regular regression is that the response variable is categorical rather than quantitative. There are three parts (that we won't do all of this week): when the outcome is a success/failure, when the outcome is several categories but ordered, when the outcome is several categories that are not ordered. There are also variations in how the data come to us (and therefore how we have to deal with it).
  - Next week's tutorial (the 22nd) is on the stuff in this week's lecture, and Assignment 2 (opens on the 22nd and is due on the 28th) is on the same material.

- 2024-01-11 20:45: we have a Zoom meeting set up for Monday's tutorial. The coordinates are in a Quercus announcement (I am not announcing it publicly).

- 2024-01-11 11:45: Here is [a worksheet](worksheet_1_d29.html) on the material we looked at in class yesterday. I'm not promising a worksheet every week, but I will point you at some practice problems for each section of the course. Look out for information about Monday's session tomorrow (once I have sorted that out).

- 2024-01-08 12:45: Our course begins this week:
  - expect things to be structured a lot like they were in C32.
  - one two-hour lecture a week, on Wednesdays (I will give you a break in the middle). Your ACORN has the location.
  - one hour of tutorial-slash-office hour on Mondays, starting *next* week, probably on zoom. You can also catch me after lecture, or post in the Quercus discussions.
  - weekly assignments, with the first one going out on January 15 (out Monday night, due the following Sunday night), in the same style as for C32.
  - D29 is more about the statistics and less about the coding than C32 was; you will be learning some statistical methods that are definitely new to you, and I will assume that you are keeping up with the coding part.

- 2024-01-03 11:00: lecture 1 is a week away:
  - Quercus page is up (for assignments, discussion board etc)
  - be ready to learn some new statistics (there will be stuff you haven't seen before)
  - I will assume that you are familiar with the R stuff, and the statistical ideas, that you learned in C32. (If you are not, be prepared to do some catching up.)
  - we begin with some new ideas in regression.
  - I don't think there is anyone taking the course as STA 1007 (graduate course) this year; if you are, let me know.

- 2023-12-12 18:30: a bit more detail:
  - lectures are once a week on Wednesdays for 2 hours
  - there is a "practical" on Mondays at 4, starting in week 2, probably on zoom. This is a sort of combined office hour / tutorial to which you can bring questions about the previous week's material.
  - weekly assignments (that you are used to from C32), opening Monday night, due the following Sunday night.
  - a 2-hour midterm and a 3-hour final as usual, on dates to be announced.

- 2023-12-08 14:30: here is this year's version of the site. Class meets once a week for two hours, starting on Wed January 10, 2024.
