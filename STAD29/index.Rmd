Welcome to the home page for STA 1007 / STAD29. This is the place to look for things course-related (notes, code, old exams etc., linked above) except for lecture videos, assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca).


## News (newest first)

- 2024-01-03 11:00: lecture 1 is a week away:
  - Quercus page is up (for assignments, discussion board etc)
  - be ready to learn some new statistics (there will be stuff you haven't seen before)
  - I will assume that you are familiar with the R stuff, and the statistical ideas, that you learned in C32. (If you are not, be prepared to do some catching up.)
  - we begin with some new ideas in regression.
  - I don't think there is anyone taking the course as STA 1007 (graduate course) this year; if you are, let me know.

- 2023-12-12 18:30: a bit more detail:
  - lectures are once a week on Wednesdays for 2 hours
  - there is a "practical" on Mondays at 4, starting in week 2, probably on zoom. This is a sort of combined office hour / tutorial to which you can bring questions about the previous week's material.
  - weekly assignments (that you are used to from C32), opening Monday night, due the following Sunday night.
  - a 2-hour midterm and a 3-hour final as usual, on dates to be announced.

- 2023-12-08 14:30: here is this year's version of the site. Class meets once a week for two hours, starting on Wed January 10, 2024.
