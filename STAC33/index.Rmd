#  Introduction to Applied Statistics

## Ken Butler

![bad picture](ken.jpg){width=400px}

Welcome to the home page for STAC33. This is the place to look for all things course-related (notes, announcements etc.) except for assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca).

In this course, we learn R, and how to use this software for data organization and to apply statistical methods that you (mostly) already know. I emphasize the communication of the results. That is to say, you need to *get* the answers, but you also need to be able to *explain to others* what the results mean, and *convince others why* what you have done is sensible. This is what a real-world data analyst does, and so you will need to demonstrate an ability to do that as well.


## News (most recent at the top)

- 2024-01-18 22:00: I just took a look through the assignment 0's that were handed in. If you seemed to have done the right thing and I could see it including your graph, you should have 1 mark (out of 1). If you handed something in and for some reason it didn't work, you won't have a mark but you will have a comment. Mostly this was that I couldn't see your graph. If that happened to you, figure out how to fix it before you hand in assignment 1.

- 2024-01-15 11:00: On the agenda this week:
  - Assignment 1, on the stuff you are doing on the worksheet today, will open tonight and be due next Sunday night (the 21st).
  - Lectures:
    - making graphs (Tuesday)
    - numerical summaries, choosing things from dataframes (start) (Thursday)
  - next week's tutorial (on Monday, a week from today) will feature a worksheet on the things in this week's lectures.
  - Assignment 2 (opening Monday next week) will also be on those things.

- 2024-01-15 09:30: reminder: your tutorial is *today*, for practice on Worksheet 1 and handing in "Assignment 0" (the first "real assignment" will be due next week).

- 2024-01-11 15:15: 
  - [Worksheet 1](worksheet_1_c33.html), for practice on this week's material. 
  - The two datafiles I forgot earlier: [coffee.txt](coffee.txt), [migraine.txt](migraine.txt). You should be able to find course datafiles at a URL like `http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/filename.txt` where you replace `filename.txt` by whatever the file is called.

- 2024-01-11 11:45: looking out of my office window, I might as well repeat Tuesday's announcement!
  - after today's lecture, I will post Worksheet 1, which gives you a chance to work through some of the stuff we've seen so far. You can work through it during tutorial, or before (and bring any problems or confusions to tutorial).
  - Assignment 1 will open after Monday's tutorial, and will be due the following Sunday night (Jan 21). Expect the same structure each week: working through the worksheet, with help available in tutorial, will prepare you for the next assignment, and doing the assignments (yourself!) will prepare you for the exams.
  - Data files for today's lecture: [test1.xls](test1.xls), [test1.csv](test1.csv), [test2.xls](test2.xls)

- 2024-01-09 10:40: campus is open, I am here, and the weather looks worse than it actually is, so class goes ahead today. On the agenda for this week:
  - today: course outline and running R
  - Thursday: reading data from files.

- 2024-01-08 12:25: first lecture is tomorrow; your ACORN has the location. Here is a short description of how things will go:
  - Two one-hour lectures a week, Tuesday and Thursday. I will have office hours after each lecture, or you can talk with me at the end of lecture, or you can post in the Quercus discussions for the course.
  - You should be registered in one of the three tutorials (on Mondays, starting next week, in week 2 of classes).
  - In tutorial, you will get a worksheet to work through yourself (with my answers and extra discussion). There will be at least one TA in attendance. Ask for help if you get stuck or confused.
  - There will be weekly assignments, with the first one opening on January 15 after tutorial (and due the following Sunday night). There will be about eight assignments altogether, with no assignments due during reading week or around the midterm.
  - Each item helps you with the next on the list: doing the worksheet will help you with the corresponding assignment, and doing the assignments will help you with the exams.
  - The first part of the [lecture notes](https://ritsokiguess.site/STAC33/notes.html) contains the course outline. Read this now, to get a more detailed idea of what to expect.

- 2024-01-03 11:10: lecture 1 is just under a week away. I am assuming that you are completely familiar with basic statistical techniques, such as:
  - what graphs are available to you for each kind of data, and how to interpret them
  - what a hypothesis test does and does not do
  - tests for one and two and more than two means ($t$-tests for the first two and ANOVA for the third)
  - how to apply all of these to data and to interpret the results
  - basic probability distributions
  - we will learn how to do all of the above in R (I assume you know nothing about R).
  
  There is very little actual math in this course, but there are a lot of ideas, and there is a lot of explanation of those ideas as they apply to data. Thus, you need to understand the theory that you have learned, but you also need to know how it applies to the data in front of you.
  
  If you have learned some R before, you may see that I do things differently from what you learned before. I am expecting you to do things in this course *as I teach them*. All the work in this course can be done using ideas from this course, except where I say otherwise.

- 2023-12-14 14:05: I found room for a few more students, 4th years in either our Major or Specialist programs. I know there are not very many C or D level courses in the winter semester, so these seemed to be the people whose need was greatest.

- 2023-12-12 16:30: I've been doing some planning for this course. Here's what to expect:
  - lectures Tuesday and Thursday (1 hour each)
  - tutorial Monday, in a computer lab, in which you will get a worksheet to work through on the material from the previous week's lecture, with a TA or two around to help if you get stuck or confused. Tutorials start in week 2.
  - weekly assignments open on Monday night, on the same material as the worksheet you just did, and are due the following Sunday night. The first assignment will open in week 2.
  - there will be about 8 assignments.
  - a midterm (2 hours) and a final exam (3 hours) as usual, on dates to be announced. I will move any assignments with due dates close to the midterm, as needed. My exams are always open book.
  - the worksheets will help you with the assignments, and the assignments will help you with the exams, provided you do them yourself.

- 2023-08-10 13:30: I have asked to add some students to the course. These are all UTSC students, 4th years who joined the waitlist before August 9, and 3rd years who joined the waitlist before 10:30am on July 11. If you are still on the waitlist after this has been processed, you will have to take your chances.

- 2023-08-10 12:50: I am aware that the course has a longish waitlist. I have room to add a few more students. I will be prioritizing 4th years, since I know that majors/minors/specialists require a certain number of upper-level courses to complete their programs. If there is room to admit 3rd years, I will do so in the order that they joined the waitlist. This is (historically) a popular class, and it is up to you to register for it as early as possible if you want to get in. *Do not* appeal to me for special treatment. The choice of students to add is mine.
